  # The gate STUDIO did not have.
  #
  # MASTER, RAILS and OPENBSD each have a suite that fails when their tree
  # breaks. STUDIO had nothing — and it is the tree most exposed, because
  # `MASTER/bin/gate`'s /fix step mutates the whole shared worktree and has
  # silently broken dilla and postpro before. The only thing standing between
  # that and a broken engine was `dilla debug`, which nobody runs after a fix
  # and which covers dilla alone: the other 13 Ruby files in STUDIO — postpro,
  # repligen, the nine lora toolkit scripts — had nothing checking them at all.
  #
  # Three checks, in increasing order of what they can catch:
  #
  #   parse     every first-party Ruby file in STUDIO is syntactically valid.
  #   inventory nothing in STUDIO is orphaned, and dilla's file list still
  #             matches the disk.
  #   load      the guarded entry points actually boot.
  #
  # The third is the one that earns its keep. A rename or a deleted constant
  # passes `ruby -c` on every file and dies at load, which is exactly the shape
  # an autofix produces — and STUDIO/dilla/lib/engine_sources.rb says so in its
  # own header: "the parse check reported 'ruby syntax: ok' over a set that
  # excluded all thirty lib/*.rb files, which is the check MASTER's autofix has
  # already broken this engine past."
  #
  # Deliberately cheap: parse is in-process AST, and both load probes finish in
  # about a second each. No render, no audio, no gems beyond what the entry
  # points already require, so this can run in a routine check profile rather
  # than being the thing someone remembers to run.

    # loadable entry point — see UNGUARDED below for why repligen is one.
