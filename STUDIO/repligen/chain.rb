# A chain is several models in a row, where each stage's output is the next
# stage's input.
#
# repligen was single-shot: one model, one prompt, optionally one --postpro
# handoff at the end. That is enough to make a picture and not enough to make
# one nobody has seen, because a single model produces the look it was trained
# to produce. What produces an unfamiliar image is passing a frame through
# several models that disagree about what an image is.
#
# The FLUX 2 family is unusually suited to it, and the reason is worth stating
# because it decides how a chain should be written: those models are decomposed
# by what they PRESERVE. flux-depth-pro holds 3D spatial relationships while the
# surface changes completely; flux-canny-pro holds edges; flux-fill-pro holds
# the surroundings; flux-2-max holds a character across a batch from up to eight
# reference images. They are not five ways to make a picture. They are five ways
# to change one thing while holding a different invariant — which is exactly
# what a chain needs, because a chain of stages that each preserve nothing
# converges on mush by stage four.
#
# The validation here matters more than the execution. repligen's whole design
# is to refuse an option a model does not accept rather than let the API ignore
# it, because a request that "works" while silently dropping a setting is far
# harder to notice than a 422. A chain multiplies that: stage 6 failing because
# stage 2 could not produce what stage 3 assumed is a bad afternoon and a real
# bill. So a chain is validated whole, before anything is spent.

    # chaining: Depth Anything takes `image`, IC-Light takes `subject_image`,
    # and the FLUX control models take `control_image`. Against the old list all
    # three read as "declares nowhere to put an image", so the validator refused
    # exactly the chains worth building and did it with a message blaming the
    # model.
    #
