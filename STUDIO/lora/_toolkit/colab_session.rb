#
# Colab runs Python notebooks, so the notebook cannot be Ruby — but it can be a
# handover, and this is what it hands over to. Same split as every other lane:
# Ruby owns the chain, Python appears only where ai-toolkit's run.py does.
#
# Why Colab at all: Kaggle gates both GPU and internet behind phone
# verification. An unverified account gets a CPU box with no network — measured,
# not assumed: a probe kernel reported torch 2.10.0+cpu, no nvidia-smi, no DNS,
# and no ruby. Colab's free tier asks for a Google account and nothing else.
#
# The GPU is the same 16 GB Turing T4 Kaggle would have given, so the cuda_t4
# profile in render_config.rb applies unchanged: fp16 because Turing has no
# bf16, quantised because 16 GB will not hold FLUX.1-dev otherwise.
