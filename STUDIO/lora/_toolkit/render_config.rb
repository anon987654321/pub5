# materialises them in host RAM before quantisation can move anything to the
# card; a free Colab has 12.7 GB and the kernel is killed at "Loading checkpoint
# shards". Swap would let it spill, and Colab's container refuses swapon. There
# is no arrangement of that machine in which 23.8 fits in 12.7.
#
# SDXL is 6.9 GB and fits with room to spare. It is a genuine step down for this
# job — 2.6B UNet against a 12B rectified-flow transformer — and where it shows
# is exactly the thing a subject LoRA is for: FLUX holds a specific face across
# changes of light and angle, SDXL drifts toward a generic one as the scene
# varies, and it follows a long prompt less faithfully. Twelve validation
# prompts each naming a lighting setup, a film stock and a focal length are more
# than it will honour.
#
# It is the right call anyway when the alternative is no photographs tonight.
#
# Everything FLUX-specific has to go, not just the path. flowmatch is FLUX's
# scheduler and SDXL wants ddpm. guidance 3.5 is a FLUX number; SDXL is trained
# for about 7 and looks washed out below 5. quantize exists to make 12B fit and
# costs quality on a model that already does. And SDXL is trained at 1024, so
# the 512 buckets the T4 profile imposes for FLUX would train it below its own

# nothing, so the adapter came out untrained while the run looked healthy from

#

# VAE has activations that exceed fp16's range. Everywhere else the answer is
# bf16 — and Turing, which is what a free Colab T4 is, has no bf16 at all. That
# is the same constraint that forced fp16 here in the first place, so the two
# requirements collide and the VAE is the only place to break the deadlock.
