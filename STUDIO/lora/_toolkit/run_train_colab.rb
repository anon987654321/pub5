# Fourth train lane: Google Colab. Free 16 GB T4, no phone verification.
#
# Unlike the Kaggle lane there is no API to push to and no way to drive this
# headlessly — Colab is a browser. What there is, is a GitHub loader: a notebook
# committed to a public repo opens in Colab from a URL. So this writes the
# notebook into the subject directory, and you commit it and click the link.
#
# The notebook clones this repo for the toolkit and the captioned dataset, which
# is the right dependency here for the reason it was the wrong one on Kaggle:
# Colab has no dataset mount to carry a payload in, and the repo is public.
#
# Usage:
#   ./lora --train-colab            # write the notebook, print the URL
#   ./lora --train-colab --steps 900
#
# Env:
#   LORA_COLAB_STEPS        default 1800
#   LORA_COLAB_SAMPLE_EVERY default 500
#   PUB4_REPO / PUB4_BRANCH the checkout the notebook clones

#
# The clone is what makes this lane need no token, and it is also the reason to
# think before using it: PUB4_REPO defaults to the public pub4 origin, so
# "clone the repo for the dataset" means "publish the photographs first". For
# generated subjects that is fine. For photographs of a person it is a decision
# nobody should make by running a notebook.
#
# Drive is already mounted a few cells above, for checkpoints. The same mount
# carries a dataset, so the images reach the GPU without reaching GitHub: put
# them in MyDrive/lora/<subject>/dataset and this prefers them over anything in
# the checkout.
#
# It fails rather than falling through when neither source has images. A lane
# that trains on an empty directory produces a LoRA of nothing after several
# hours, and the failure would surface as a bad likeness rather than as a
