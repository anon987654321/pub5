# most-heard sound in the session and it is asked to be sharper: two pieces of
# wood under immense pressure, a chainsaw catching. That is a comb resonator
# ringing at a pitch it is being dragged through, ring modulated so the ring is
# metallic rather than tonal, wavefolded so the peaks turn back instead of
# rounding off, and hard clipped. Loud enough to cut, short enough not to tire.
