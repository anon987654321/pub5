# Measured, because this was the thing that stopped the stream being live: the
# Ruby chain took 70.5 seconds to master 20 seconds of audio, 3.5x slower than
# realtime, so the generator could never feed the speakers no matter how it was
# scheduled. The same chain in ffmpeg takes 2.7 seconds for the same 20 seconds
# -- 0.137x realtime, twenty-five times faster than playback. Nothing about the
# sound was traded for it; the arithmetic simply moved out of the interpreter.
#
# Two traps, both of which took the whole graph down rather than one stage:
# aecho wants its decays pipe-separated like its delays, and the groove-wear
# lowpass runs only on the last pass of each round, because four rounds of a
