# The chop pipeline runs demucs, keeps bass, guitar, piano and other, and
# discards drums and vocals. Discarding the drums is right -- the whole point is
# a bed to put OUR kit on. Discarding the vocals was not thought about; it fell
# out of the same line.
#
# Donuts is built on vocal chops. Not sung lines: fragments, a syllable or a
# word, used as rhythm and as punctuation, often too short to make out. They are
# the most recognisable thing about the record and we had them separated,
# written to disk, and deleted.
#
# This recovers them. No new separation is needed -- demucs already wrote
# vocals.wav for every thirty-second cut it examined, and those files are still
# in the scratch directory. All that is required is to take the same span the
# loop was taken from, out of the vocal stem instead of the instrumental one.
