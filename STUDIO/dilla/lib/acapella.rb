# Putting somebody's vocal on our beat, in time.
#
# The problem is not separation -- demucs does that. The problem is that a rap
# vocal recorded at 94 beats per minute laid over a beat running at 83 drifts
# steadily out of time, and by the end of a verse the rapper is a beat and a
# half early. Syncing it means three things, in this order:
#
#   1. What tempo was the original?
#   2. Where is its first downbeat?
#   3. Stretch it to our tempo without moving its pitch, and start it on our
#      first downbeat.
#
# The first question is the one that decides everything, and it must be asked of
# the FULL TRACK, not the vocal. An isolated vocal has no reliable pulse -- rap
# phrasing sits deliberately across the beat and a rapper may hold a syllable
# through a whole bar. The drums in the original are what state the tempo, and
# they are still there in the mix we downloaded even though we throw them away.
# So the tempo is measured on the mix and applied to the stem.

  # 1.57x, which leaves a hole: anything landing between 111 and 139 folds to
  # neither -- halve it and it falls under 70, double it and it passes 110 -- so
  # the method returned nil however good the reading was.
  #
  # That is not a threshold being strict. It is arithmetic throwing away
  # evidence. One track measured a confidence of 0.499, comfortably above the
  # 0.45 bar and better than takes that were accepted, and was reported as having
  # no readable tempo because its pulse happened to sit at 120.

    #
    # The first version borrowed RadioChop.best_period, which finds the strongest
    # repeating period in an envelope. That is the right tool for finding a
    # loopable span and the wrong one for finding a tempo: it returned 98.36 for
    # a track, which is a perfectly plausible rap tempo, and stretching a vocal
    # by it put the syllables 39 ms from the sixteenth-note grid where random
    # placement would give 45. It was not detecting the tempo. It was returning
    # a number.
    #
    # This measures the thing that matters instead. For each candidate tempo,
    # take every onset, and ask where it falls WITHIN one beat -- as an angle
    # round a circle, so a beat's start and end are the same place. If the
    # candidate is right, every onset lands near the same angle and the angles
    # cluster tightly. If it is wrong, they scatter evenly. The length of the
    # average of those angles as unit vectors is exactly that: near 1 for
    # clustered, near 0 for scattered.

  # A rap vocal wants to sit forward without getting shrill. High-passed to lose
  # the room the separator could not remove, a dip where a beat's own midrange
  # sits so the two do not fight, and levelled so a verse does not shout at a
  # chorus.
  # Sharp, meaning legible -- consonants, not level.
  #
  # What makes a rap vocal cut is the top half of speech: the 3 to 5 kHz band
  # where consonants live, and the air above 8 where breath and sibilance sit.
  # The old chain lifted 2.6 kHz, which is vowel territory -- it made the voice
  # louder and no clearer. These lift the parts that carry the words.
  #
  # A fast compressor after them, not before: the point is to catch consonant
  # peaks once they have been raised, so the quiet ones come up to meet the loud
  # ones. A 2 ms attack is fast enough to see a 't'.
  #
  # The de-esser is what lets the rest of it be this bright. Lifting 8 kHz on a
  # separated stem raises sibilance more than anything else, and a stem carries
  # separation artefacts up there too. adynamicequalizer pulls 6.5 kHz down only
  # while 6.5 kHz is loud, so the brightness stays and the spit does not.
  #
  # No loudnorm. Single-pass loudnorm is DYNAMIC -- it rides the gain through the
  # take, which on a rap vocal flattens the delivery, the loud line and the
  # muttered one arriving at the same level. That is the same fault that was
  # making the master wander, left in the vocal chain when the master was fixed.
  # The darker reading of the same voice.
  #
  # Not the bright chain with the treble turned down -- that gives a dull
  # vocal, which is a different thing from a dark one. Dark means the weight
  # moves DOWN rather than the top going away: chest lifted around 220 Hz, the
  # consonant band kept but narrowed and placed lower at 2.8 kHz so the words
  # still arrive, and the air above 7 kHz rolled off rather than boosted.
  #
  # Then tape. An atan waveshaper at low drive adds the odd harmonics that make
  # a voice sound recorded rather than captured, and it is the saturation that
  # stops the result being merely quiet at the top -- there is still something
  # happening up there, it is just harmonic rather than original.
