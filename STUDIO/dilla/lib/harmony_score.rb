# frozen_string_literal: true

# Theory-grounded progression scoring -- the harmonic counterpart to
# DillaGrooveScore (rhythm). Every metric here is derived from voice-leading/
# functional-harmony theory (see lib/theory_runtime.rb's own operators:
# common-tone retention, contrary motion, circle-of-fifths bias), not from
# similarity to any named track or producer. Mirrors DillaGrooveScore's shape
# (analyze -> {score:, breakdown:}) so both can feed the same report/recommend
# pipeline.
