# The devices: small machines with one idea each.
#
# Three files' worth of ringtone.tools-shaped primitives, in one, because they
# are one thing. Each takes a musical idea that is normally indivisible and
# splits it:
#
#   CopyMachine   one sound becomes several, at different speeds, at once.
#   Hocket        one line becomes an ensemble handing it between voices.
#   Bag           a note's PITCH and its TIME come from different parts.
#   WavMap        a picture becomes an oscillator.
#
# They were written as copy_machine.rb, midi_devices.rb and wav_map.rb and
# merged on the standing order in soul.yml: COLLAPSE_BEFORE_ADDING says try
# nine moves before writing a new file, and FLAT_HIERARCHY makes aggressive
# merge the default on every write. Three siblings of 79, 84 and 126 code lines
# that arrived in one change, share one purpose and are called from the same
# places are the "merge thin siblings into one" case exactly.
#
# What is NOT merged in here, and why: DillaModulation moves parameters rather
# than making sound, and lives with the automation it completes; DillaMacros is
# about knobs and lives with knobs.rb. Grouping by "things I added" rather than
# by what they are would be the same mistake in a bigger file.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CopyMachine
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# One sound, played several times at once, at different speeds.
#
# ringtone.tools' Copy Machine is the clearest small statement of an old idea:
# take a sample, play up to thirty-two copies of it simultaneously at different
# playback rates, let some of them run backwards. It is not a chorus and it is
# not a pitch shifter. Every copy is the whole sound at its own speed, so the
# copies drift apart in TIME as well as pitch -- a copy at 0.5x is still playing
# the first bar when the original is on the second -- and what comes out is a
# smeared, self-harmonising cloud that no single-voice effect produces.
#
# This engine already has the nearest thing to it and it is not the same thing.
# The granular pad cloud (pad_layers.rb) does simultaneous grains with octave
# shimmer, sub-octave haze and reversal -- but grains, at 30-400 ms, confined to
# the pad layer and to the chord sounding underneath each grain. organic_vary.rb
# does multi-speed copies of a loop but SEQUENTIALLY, concatenated pass after
# pass, so at any instant exactly one copy is sounding. Neither stacks whole
# copies of a sound on top of each other, which is the entire effect here.
#
# Varispeed, not pitch shift, and this is the decision the sound rests on.
# asetrate resamples: pitch and duration move together, the way a tape machine
# or a sampler's pitch knob does. A formant-preserving shift would keep every
# copy the same length and turn this into a chord; letting them run at their own
# lengths is what makes it a cloud. sample_loops.rb reaches the same conclusion
# for the same reason and says so.
module CopyMachine
  module_function

  # Speeds, as ratios to the original.
  #
  # Two families, because the choice between them is musical rather than
  # technical and neither is right for everything.
  #
  #   :harmonic   ratios from the harmonic series and its inverse -- 2, 3/2, 4/3,
  #               1/2, 2/3. Every copy lands on a note the original already
  #               implies, so a chord comes out sounding like one instrument
  #               played wide rather than like several instruments disagreeing.
  #               This is the default because the material this engine makes is
  #               harmonic and a cloud that fights the chord is noise.
  #
  #   :chromatic  equal-tempered semitone steps. Denser and more synthetic; the
  #               copies are in tune with the twelve-tone grid rather than with
  #               the sound's own overtones, which reads as a machine.
  #
  #   :spray      irrationals. Nothing is in tune with anything, which past four
  #               or five copies stops being harmony and becomes texture. The
  #               Copy Machine setting, and the one that sounds least like a

# MidiDevices
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Two devices that rearrange notes rather than process sound.
#
# Both come from ringtone.tools and both are the same kind of idea: take
# something a sequencer treats as one indivisible thing and split it in two, so
# the halves can come from different places. They are in one file because they
# share the engine's note-event contract, and a change to that contract has to
# change both or neither.
#
# THE CONTRACT. A note event here is what write_smf and the pad/lead renderers
# already pass around:
#
#   [time_seconds, velocity_0_to_1, { hz: [frequencies] }, sustain_seconds]
#
# Nothing below invents a note. Every note that comes out of these went in --
# what changes is when it sounds, or which voice it comes out of. That is the
# whole reason they are safe to add to an engine whose harmony is already
# decided elsewhere: they cannot produce a pitch the progression did not.
module MidiDevices
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------ Hocket
  #
  # One line, distributed across several destinations.
  #
  # Named for the medieval technique -- hoquetus, a hiccup -- where a single
  # melody is split between two voices that alternate note by note, so neither
  # sings the tune and both do. Ringtone's Hocket II sends incoming notes to up
  # to eight MIDI channels; the musical effect is that a line played on one
  # instrument becomes a line played BY an ensemble, and the ear reconstructs it.
  #
  # Nothing in this engine does this. There is no voice allocation anywhere: a
  # lead is a lead, a pad is a pad, and a phrase belongs to whichever renderer
  # made it start to finish. Which is why a dilla render can sound like several
  # loops playing at once rather than like several players in a room -- the parts
  # never hand anything to each other.

    #   :pendulum     1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2. Turns at the ends instead of
    #                 jumping back, so the line travels across the ensemble and
    #                 returns rather than snapping. Ringtone II added this and it
    #                 is the more musical of the two by a distance.
    #   :shift_register  an analog shift register: a bit is clocked along a chain
    #                 and a new one enters at random. Voices repeat in runs and
    #                 then change, which is how a pattern that is not a pattern
    #                 sounds. This is the Buchla/Serge idea, not a random choice
    #                 with a nice name -- the state is a register and it shifts.

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------- MIDI Bag
  #
  # Pitch from one place, rhythm from another.
  #
  # Ringtone's MIDI Bag records some notes, then switches mode: incoming MIDI
  # becomes the TIMING and the recorded notes supply the PITCHES. A note event is
  # normally an indivisible pair -- this note, at this moment -- and the device
  # refuses that pairing. What comes out is the melody's notes in the
  # drums' rhythm, or the bassline's pitches on the hi-hat grid.
  #
  # WHAT THIS ENGINE ALREADY HAS, and why this is still worth adding. sample_flip
  # does the same separation and does it better in one respect: it detects the
  # pitch of each slice of a record and chooses, per beat, the slice that fits
  # the chord underneath -- pitch source and time source separated AND
  # harmonically constrained. But it does it for audio slices only, and only
  # inside its own four-step pipeline. Nothing does it for note events, so a
  # melody the engine generated cannot be re-rhythmed by a pattern the engine
  # also generated. That is the gap.
  #
  # The harmonic constraint is worth keeping though, so it is offered here:
  # `chord_at` lets the caller pass the progression, and pitches that do not fit
  # the chord under their new position can be nudged to one that does. Off by
  # default, because the whole point of the device is that the pitches come from
  # somewhere else and forcing them into the chord is one way to lose that.

# WavMap

# A picture, read as a waveform.

# ringtone.tools' wav_Map treats an image as a height field -- brightness is
# elevation -- and traces a closed path across that surface. The heights along
# the path, in order, are one cycle of a waveform. Play that cycle at a pitch and
# the picture becomes a tone whose harmonic content is the picture's texture.
#
# The path is CLOSED for a reason that is not decorative: a cycle whose end does
# not meet its start has a step discontinuity at the loop point, and a step
# repeating at the fundamental is a buzz at every harmonic. Closing the path
# makes the waveform periodic by construction, which is the difference between
# an instrument and a fault.

# LowPassGate
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Buchla low-pass gate: loudness and brightness fall together.
#
# Every dynamic stage in this engine separates the two. A VCA changes level and
# leaves the tone alone; a filter changes tone and leaves the level alone; the
# grain cloud and the tape model touch neither. So a note here decays by getting
# quieter while staying exactly as bright as it started, which is a thing no
# acoustic sound does -- strike anything and its top end dies before its
# amplitude does, because the high partials are damped hardest.
#
# An LPG is that coupling made into a module. One control opens both a gain and a
# lowpass, so a decaying note darkens as it fades. It is the single reason
# West-Coast synthesis sounds struck rather than played, and there was nothing in
# this engine that could do it.
#
# THE VACTROL IS THE INSTRUMENT. A photocell facing an LED responds fast to light
# arriving and slowly to light leaving, and the slow side is not exponential --
# it is a lag whose time constant grows as the cell darkens. That asymmetry is
# what separates an LPG from a filter and a VCA wired to the same envelope; the
# same patch with a linear envelope sounds synthetic, and the difference is
# entirely in the decay's shape.
#
# Pure Ruby on samples, for the reason tape_hysteresis.rb gives about its own
# model: this is per-sample state, output depends on history, and no ffmpeg
# filter has the behaviour. Reuses SampleFlip's decode/encode so the file paths
# are the ones the rest of the engine already uses.
