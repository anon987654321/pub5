# Everything in this engine is set once. A render picks a lowpass cutoff, a
# compressor threshold, a phaser speed, and that number holds from bar one to
# the end. That is why a dilla render reads as a loop with sections rather than
# as a performance: nothing on the signal path is being played while it runs.
#
# automation_lane.rb is the one exception and it is a narrow one. It builds a
# right-nested `if(lt(t,X),A,B)` ladder for `volume`, which works because volume
# takes an EXPRESSION re-evaluated per frame. Its own header records the wall it
# hit: lowpass and highpass reject that syntax, so everything except gain was
# out of reach, and it says the fix would be "asendcmd with a timed command
# file, which is a different, heavier mechanism not implemented here".
#
# This is that mechanism, and the wall was lower than it looked. ffmpeg marks
# every runtime-settable option with T in its flags column, and the list is
# large -- measured against the ffmpeg this repo actually runs (8.1.1):
#
#   lowpass/highpass     frequency width mix
#   equalizer/bass/treble frequency width gain mix
#   acompressor          threshold ratio attack release makeup knee mix level_sc
#   alimiter             limit level_in level_out attack release
#   acrusher             bits mix mode dc aa samples lfo lforange lforate
#   stereotools          balance_in balance_out slev sbal mlev mpan delay phase

#   atempo               tempo
#
# Proved end to end before any of this was written: white noise through
# `asendcmd=f=cmds,lowpass@m1=f=400` with the cutoff stepped 400 -> 15000 moved
# the energy above 6 kHz from -66.7 dB to -16.9 dB. A 50 dB sweep, on a filter
# the previous note called unautomatable.
#
# The one detail that decides whether any of this works: asendcmd's TARGET is
# the filter's INSTANCE name, `lowpass@m1`, not the instance id `m1` and not the
# class `lowpass`. Targeting `m1` sends the command nowhere and reports nothing
# -- the first sweep measured dead flat for exactly that reason. Every instance
# this module emits is named, and the name it writes into the command file is
# the name it wrote into the graph.
#
# What this deliberately is NOT:
#
#   - audio rate. Commands land on frame boundaries, so this is a control-rate
#     mechanism: musical movement over bars and beats, not FM. Anything that
#     has to move per sample belongs in Ruby with the grain cloud and the
#     hysteresis model, or in an expression on `volume`.
#   - a new sound by default. Nothing here is reached unless a caller builds a
#     matrix. The engine's existing renders are unchanged, which is the only
#     honest way to add a mechanism this wide to a tool whose output nobody can
#     re-audition.

# ---------------------------------------------------------- volume expressions
#
# The expression form of the same idea, absorbed from automation_lane.rb.
#
# It was a 21-code-line file, under FILE_SPRAWL's own "absorb files smaller than
# 25 lines into their closest owner" threshold, and its closest owner is this
# one: its header described the wall this module climbs, and this module's
# header cites it back. Two files for one subject, one of them too small to
# stand on its own.
#
# Both forms stay, because they are not interchangeable. `volume` takes an
# EXPRESSION re-evaluated per frame, which is exact and costs no command file;
# everything else needs asendcmd. Kept under its original module name so
# master_heuristics.rb and render_analog.rb are untouched by the move.
# Generic "any parameter can vary over time" helper — the ffmpeg-expression
# equivalent of a DAW automation lane. Several places in dilla.rb hand-build
# a one-off `if(lt(t,X),A,B)':eval=frame` volume expression (radio_club_morph
# being the clearest example); this replaces the ad-hoc string-building with
# one function so a third breakpoint, or a new automated parameter, is a data
# change instead of a new hand-rolled expression.
#
# Only proven against ffmpeg's `volume` filter (`eval=frame` + `t` variable).
# `lowpass`/`highpass` do NOT accept this syntax (confirmed empirically) —
# automating those needs `asendcmd` with a timed command file instead, which
# is a different, heavier mechanism not implemented here.

# Sources and destinations as data, so a patch is a table rather than code.
#
# Everything above can already build any patch; what it could not do was let
# anything OTHER than a programmer build one. A route needs a filter name, a
# parameter name, a base, a range and a scale, and getting any of them wrong is
# either an exception or -- worse -- a route that ffmpeg accepts and ignores.
# That is a fine interface for a caller and a hopeless one for a rotation, a
# macro, or a random patcher.
#
# So the bay names a small set of things worth modulating, in musical terms, and
# resolves each to the filter and parameter underneath. `cutoff` rather than
# `lowpass.frequency`; `bite` rather than `acrusher.bits`. Two consequences that
# matter more than the convenience: a patch can be written by something that
# knows nothing about ffmpeg, and every destination here is one that has been
# checked to be runtime-settable, so a patch cannot silently do nothing.
