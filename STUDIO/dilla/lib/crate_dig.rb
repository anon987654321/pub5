# Crate digging over sources that are actually free to sample.
#
# The engine's existing external material comes from two places: `fetch-assets`
# (CC0 drum one-shots + soundfonts, checksummed) and `samples/own/` (recordings
# by the operator and named collaborators). Everything else under `samples/` was
# ripped from YouTube, which is neither licensed nor defensible, and this does
# not add to that pile.
#
# What it does instead is dig the collections the lineage actually rests on and
# that are free to use:
#
#   great78    Internet Archive's Great 78 Project. ~400k digitised 78rpm sides,
#              filtered here to the ones whose copyright has actually expired --
#              see pd_year_ceiling. That is where the jazz, blues, gospel and
#              vocal-group DNA lives.
#   librivox   Public-domain spoken word, for the spoken fragments the idiom uses
#              between tracks.
#
# The point is not that these are the same records. It is that chopping,
# filtering, pitching and drunk-swinging a public-domain 78 puts you in the same
# place, and the result clears.

  # The Great 78 Project digitises far past the public domain -- an unfiltered

  # Music Modernization Act, 2018: US sound recordings published before 1923
  # entered the public domain on 2022-01-01, and everything from 1923 on gets a
  # 100-year term expiring on the 1 January after it. So a 1925 side is public
  # domain during 2026 and a 1926 side is not until 2027. Computed, not
  # hardcoded, so the crate widens by one year each January instead of rotting.

  # This covers US recordings only. Non-US material can carry a different term,
  # which is why `rights` and `licenseurl` are recorded per item rather than

  # is 1978, against a PD ceiling of 1925. Searching the Great 78 collection for
  # reggae, ska, mento, dub, Jamaica, Trinidad or the West Indies returns zero
  # rows -- not few, zero. That idiom cannot be dug from the public domain
  # because it did not exist yet.
  #
