# Part of the dilla engine, split out of dilla.rb. Defines methods and
# constants at top level exactly as it did there; dilla.rb requires the
# parts in the file's original order, because several constants are
# computed at load time from ones declared above them.

# One demo-all at a time, for the same reason stream() takes a lock.
#
# Two of them share scratch/all_tracks_demo and they do not share it politely.
# Each part is written through an intermediate and renamed into place, so while
# one run is rewriting a part the other sees that path not exist -- and the join
# reads all 86 paths at once, so it only has to lose the race on one of them to
# die after hours of rendering. That happened twice tonight. It presents as a
# file that "vanished": ffmpeg reports no such file, and by the time anyone looks
# the part is back, because the other process finished its rename.
#
# It also produces the subtler version. A part read while it is half-written is a
# valid, playable, TRUNCATED wav -- one came out at 20.9s against its neighbours'
# 53.0s and passed every check, because `ok` only asks whether the file is bigger
# than 50 kB.
#
# Same shape as acquire_stream_lock!, and mirrored deliberately rather than
# generalised: the two locks guard different directories and there is no third
# caller to justify the abstraction yet.

  # between rendering them and publishing them passed. `ok` gates on
  # File.size > 50_000, which a silent WAV satisfies easily. The lengths were
  # measured and matched the arithmetic exactly. The concat succeeded. The
