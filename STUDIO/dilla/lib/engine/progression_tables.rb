# The progression catalogue and per-track presets.
#
# Part of the dilla engine, split out of dilla.rb. Defines methods and
# constants at top level exactly as it did there; dilla.rb requires the
# parts in the file's original order, because several constants are
# computed at load time from ones declared above them.

# Album / track progressions — verified first; rest are experimental / theory pack.
# --- extended progressions -------------------------------------------------
#
# Every one of the 218 progressions above tops out at 8 chords, and 138 of
# them are exactly 4. At chord_bars 2 a four-chord progression closes its
# circle every 8 bars, so a 32-bar render walks the same ground four times --
# which is the "loops too much, same over and over" complaint in its harmonic
# form rather than its arrangement form.
#
# These are 12 and 16 chords, so the cycle is 24-32 bars: the harmony resolves
# once across the whole beat instead of four times. Longer is not automatically
# better -- a long progression that merely wanders is worse than a short one
# that closes -- so each of these is built on a specific device that gives it
# direction over that distance:
#
#   a descending bass line, which carries a listener through changes that
#   would otherwise feel arbitrary (the reason ii-V chains and chromatic
#   descents show up in so much neo-soul);
#
#   or a delayed return to the tonic, where the first arrival is deliberately
#   weak and the real cadence is saved for the end.
#
# F# minor is over-represented because the reference set is: five of the nine
# local tracks in the Radio Bergen dossiers sit there, so the keys the pads
# reach for should too.
# Progressions organised by harmonic DEVICE rather than by mood.
#
# The device is the reusable part: once "backdoor" or "chromatic mediant" is in
# the vocabulary it applies in any key, and the engine already transposes. The
# existing tables are largely named for feel (warm_minor_vamp, neo_soul_pocket),
# which makes them hard to reach for deliberately when a specific harmonic move
# is wanted.
#
# Written mostly in C, F and Eb for readability; the key is arbitrary.
#
# Every symbol here was checked against chord_from_symbol before landing --
# the first draft had 21 that did not parse, because plain major is the EMPTY
# suffix in CHORD_SUFFIXES, not "maj", so CmajoverG is invalid and CoverG is
# right. test_device_progressions_all_resolve keeps that true.

# The canonical patterns, in plain voicings on purpose.
#
# These are the progressions any theory discussion returns to -- Roman-numeral
# patterns, not anyone's song. Four of them were absent from a table of 383,
# which is the kind of gap that comes from building outward from one idiom: the
# neo-soul and Dilla families were filled in exhaustively and the common ground
# underneath them never got written down.
#
# Plain triads and sevenths, and that is the point rather than laziness.
# Measured across the whole table, 65% of its 1,942 chord events are maj9 or
# m9; dominants are 13% and bare triads under 1%. A ninth on every chord is one
# colour, and a progression that is famous for its MOTION arrives sounding like
# every other entry here if it is voiced the same way. The axis progression is
# about the four roots, not about the extensions -- so it gets the four roots.
#
# Anything wanting the lush version can reach for the families above; the point
# of these is that they are the plain statement the others are variations on.

  # That is why so much of the catalogue sounds like one harmonic colour --
  # not too few entries, too few qualities across them.
  #
  # Two things had to be true before writing more. First, m7b5, mMaj7, m6 and
  # 7#5 had to actually voice as themselves; until today m7b5 built a plain
  # minor 7, so every half-diminished ii below would have been a lie. Second,
  # the qualities had to survive the whole path, which is why none of these
  # lean on 7b9 or on the 9th of an m9 -- both still lose a note to the
  # four-voice cap, and a progression should not be written against a chord
  # the engine cannot yet play.
  #
  # These are built, not transcribed. No claim is made that any record plays
  # them.

  # The minor ii-V that the half-diminished fix makes possible at all: the ii

  # Hybrid: base feel stays Dilla-character (:syncopated_slash_ninth, same
  # pocket family as pedal_e_descent) so DRUM_STYLE_ALTERNATE genuinely
  # alternates -- CONCRETE_SOUL_MIX turns that on, flipping every other
  # phrase_bars-block into :techno_house's real four-on-the-floor
  # DRUM_PATTERN_SETS entry (straight kicks, dense 16th hats). Swing at
  # this engine's floor (50 -- SWING is clamped 50..66 everywhere in this
  # file, so "straighter than dilla" tops out here, not true 0 swing) so
  # neither phrase type feels like it's fighting the other's pocket. Carries
  # the full harmonic engine most techno never touches: tritone-sub-capable
  # functional progression, theory-scored voice-leading, fugue-conversation
  # ghost answers, rotating drum archetypes, room print. CONCRETE_SOUL_MIX
  # (see below) then forces the mix harder.

  # ==========================================================================
  # One track per dance feel (2026-07-30). A DRUM_PATTERN_SETS entry that no
  # preset names is only reachable by setting FEEL by hand, and a progression
  # that no preset names is only reachable by setting PROGRESSION by hand;
  # these pair each new grid with a new harmony so both arrive by TRACK=name,
  # show up in the medley, and can be listened to instead of read.
  #
  # The tempos are the tradition's own, not the file's usual 84-96 -- a two-step
  # at 90 is not a two-step -- and the swing is deliberately low across all of
  # them. The Dilla lean and a dance floor want opposite things from the same
  # sixteenth: one wants it late and human, the other wants it exactly where the
  # foot already is.
