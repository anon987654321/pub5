# Morphing the kit across a track: Detroit, then the LA beat scene, then

#
# A track has exactly one feel. Patterns rotate inside it bar to bar, but the
# vocabulary never changes, so a long piece states one idea for its whole
# length. The operator asked for the drums to travel between the three
# families "smoothly", which is a thing this had no way to express.
#
# The voices hand over one at a time, and that is the whole trick. Switching
# every voice on the same bar is a cut -- the listener hears a new song. A
# producer moves the hats first, because the hats are the least load-bearing
# part of the bar and the ear forgives them changing; then the snare, which is
# the reference the bar is counted against; and the kick last, because the kick
# is what makes it the same piece of music. By the time the kick moves, the
# rest of the kit has already been in the new idiom for a while and the change
# lands as arrival rather than as edit.
#
# DRUM_MORPH=0 turns it off and every voice takes the track's own feel, which
# is the previous behaviour exactly.

# EARLIER. The hats therefore carry the largest number and the kick zero --
# written the other way round first, which put the kick in the new idiom four
# bars in while the hats were still in the old one. That is the handover

  #
  # But a phrase length, not the whole body: letting the cycle equal the body

# --- Parts entering and leaving --------------------------------------------
#
# The engine has known about sections for a long time -- intro, main, breakdown,
# build, outro, with twenty-six places in this file that branch on which one is
# playing. What none of them did was change WHICH INSTRUMENTS are sounding. Every
# layer started at bar one, played to the end, and stopped. Bar 1 and bar 16 had
# the same parts at the same density, which is what "it loops over and over" and
# "most were repetitive trash" describe: not a lack of ideas, a lack of anything
# arriving or leaving.
#
# An arrangement is mostly subtraction. The intro states the chords with almost
# nothing under them; the drums arrive and that arrival is the event; the
# breakdown takes them away again so their return means something; the outro
# removes one thing at a time. None of that needs new material -- it is the
# material already rendered, gated in time.
#
# Gains rather than mutes, mostly. A layer dropping to zero and back is a hard
# edit and sounds like one; dropping to a third leaves the part audible as a
# memory of itself. Zero is reserved for the places a hard entrance is the point.
#
# :harm is here with no reductions on purpose. render_dilla asks for a :harm
# envelope on the analog pad and always has, and because the table never
# mentioned :harm that call has been a silent no-op for its whole life --
# section_layer_windows returns an empty list for an unknown layer and
# apply_section_envelope returns the chain untouched. Declaring it empty makes
# the two lists agree without changing a single sample: the pad stays at full
# level in every section, exactly as it does today. What it buys is that
# SECTION_LAYERS_DECLARED and SECTION_LAYERS_APPLIED can now be compared, so the
# next layer wired to nothing fails a test instead of looking like a feature.
#
# Giving the pads an actual section shape is a musical decision and belongs to
# the operator, not to the commit that noticed the wiring was dead.

# The arrangement the table above declines to make, offered rather than imposed.
#
# The note above is right that giving the pads a section shape is the operator's
# decision, and it stays the operator's: nothing here is reached unless
# SECTION_LAYERS=full, and the default table is untouched. What was missing is
# that the decision could not be TAKEN -- there was no shape to switch on, so
# "belongs to the operator" meant "belongs to nobody".
#
# Why it is worth having something to switch on. Measured on a default 32-bar
# render: full-band RMS across eight four-bar sections came out -19.9, -20.7,
# -21.0, -20.9, -20.9, -21.3, -20.8, -20.6. A 1.4 dB spread over the whole track,
# and flat inside 0.7 dB after bar 8. The drums, bass and sample DO follow the
# table -- their envelopes are in the graph and they work; the exact clause was
# tested in isolation and mutes by 80 dB. But that render's six channels were
# drums, harm, bass, analogpad, vinyl and rumble at weights 0.95, 1.12, 1.15,
# 0.62, 0.35 and 0.25, and four of the six -- carrying more than half the
# weight, including the loudest single channel -- had no section shape at all.
# An arrangement that moves the quiet half of a mix is not audible as one.
#
# The numbers below are gains, and the first version of this table used them as
# gains: pads at 0.72 through the intro, 1.12 in a breakdown, texture up to 1.85.
# It measured as nothing, and the reason turned out to be worth more than the
# table.
#
# An arrangement is a change in WHAT IS PLAYING, not in how loud it is. Measured
# on a 5.8-minute render, altering it at a known second and asking a spectral
# boundary detector what it can see:
#
#   a timbre change (lowpass to 800 Hz)   novelty peak 0.0044 -> 0.0624, found
#                                         at 173.9 s against an actual 174.0
#   a 6 dB level drop at the same second  0.0044 -> 0.0066, and nine spurious
#                                         boundaries rather than one real one
#
# Fourteen times against one and a half. And the two records this engine is
# measured against reach peaks of 0.0131 and 0.0252 with two to four boundaries
# each, while dilla reached 0.0044 with none -- at 32 bars and, unchanged, at
# 128. Four times the material and the same structure, because every lever the
# engine had (this table, FORM, FORM_FIT, the grain settings) moves a level.
#
# So the layers that carry an arrangement LEAVE. A gain of 0.0 is a part not
# playing, which is the one thing in this table that produces a boundary, and it
# is now what the intro and the breakdown do to the harmonic bus -- the loudest
# channel in the mix and, until this, the one that never stopped.
#
# Texture is the exception and stays a gain: vinyl noise and turntable rumble
# come UP when the band drops out, because a record's surface is what is audible
# when nothing else is, and that is the difference between a breakdown and a
# hole. It is not carrying the boundary; the parts that stop are.
SECTION_LAYER_GAIN_ARRANGED = {
# harm ducks here rather than stopping, and that is a deliberate half-measure.
#
# The measurements above argue for stopping: a timbre change reads 14x against
# a level change's 1.5x. What is missing is evidence that a removal here
# SOUNDS better, as opposed to measuring better -- and the harmony bus is the
# loudest channel in the mix, so taking it out for a whole section is a large
# musical decision to make on a detector's behalf.
#
# The mechanism is not in doubt. Section envelopes were verified end to end,
# against a reference render with the kit turned off entirely: over a 16.4 s
# intro where the table mutes the drums, kick-band RMS reads -29.0 dB against
# -29.6 for a take with no kit at all and -25.4 for one with the envelope
# disabled. It lands on the no-kit reference. In a control window where the
# same take plays its kit, it reads -25.6 against -25.8. The envelope does
# exactly what it says.
#
# What that reference also shows is why this is easy to get wrong: the kit's
# ENTIRE contribution to that band is 4.2 dB, because it is 21% of the mix
# weight sitting under a bass at 1.15. A perfect mute looks like 3.6 dB here,
# not 40, and without a no-kit arm to compare against it reads as a failure.
# Two days of hypotheses were built on exactly that misreading.
#
# So: the removal is available (set 0.0) and is not the default. See the note
# on FORM_FIT for the other half -- a section only reads as one if it also
# lasts longer than a bar.
  # harm STOPS in the intro and the breakdown, and the duration rule below is
  # what makes that safe.
  #
  # The measurements say a section boundary needs a change in what is PLAYING,
  # not in how loud it is: on a real render a timbre change at a known second
  # moved the novelty detector 14x and a 6 dB level change 1.5x. So the loudest
  # channel in the mix leaves, rather than ducking.
  #
  # The reason this was a duck until now was a misreading, and it is worth
  # keeping. A 128-bar take with the harmony muted for 43 seconds measured
  # 1.6 dB LOUDER across 250-2000 Hz than one without the envelope, which read as
  # "the envelope does nothing". It was not: the arms were not matched -- one
  # cycled its form and the other did not -- and a later three-arm test with a
  # no-kit reference showed the envelopes land exactly on the reference. The
  # mechanism was never broken; the comparison was.
  #
  # What the same reference showed is why this is easy to get wrong: a channel's
  # entire contribution to a band can be 4 dB, so a perfect mute looks like 3.6
  # and reads as a failure unless something with the channel genuinely absent is
  # measured beside it.

# A removal too short to read as a section becomes a duck instead.
#
# Both halves of this come from the same measurement. A boundary needs a change
# in WHAT IS PLAYING -- 14x against a level change's 1.5x -- and it needs to last
# long enough to be heard as a section rather than as a fault. The novelty
# detector's kernel is twelve seconds either side, and a listener is not much
# more generous.
#
# The legacy form's breakdowns are ONE BAR: 2.7 seconds at 88 BPM, three times in
# thirty-two. Taking the loudest channel in the mix out for 2.7 seconds is a beat
# drop, which is a real gesture -- but three of them in ninety seconds is a
# stutter, and it is not what the table means by "breakdown". So a full removal
# survives only in a section long enough to be one, and anywhere shorter it
# becomes a duck that still moves the balance without punching a hole.
#
# Eight seconds is roughly three bars at these tempos: long enough that the ear
# settles into the new instrumentation, short enough that a four-bar breakdown
# still qualifies. Nothing else in the table is affected -- this only ever
# softens a 0.0, and never touches a gain that was already a level change.
