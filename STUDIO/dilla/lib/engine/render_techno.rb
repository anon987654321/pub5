# TECHNO SYNTH (techno_hate.rb) — acid-industrial hybrid at 142 BPM
# =============================================================================

# --- Industrial techno, HATE-podcast shape ----------------------------------
#
# The existing render_techno is a good 8-bar loop and nothing else. Every one of
# its patterns is wrapped in mod(t, cycle), so a 213-bar render is that loop
# repeated 26 times, byte for byte. Hypnotic repetition is right for the genre;
# 26 identical repetitions is not an arrangement.
#
# What the style actually asks for, from the sources rather than from taste:
#
#   130-150 BPM, aggressive distorted sound design, heavy basslines.
#   Metallic clangs, hydraulic hisses and processed factory recordings layered
#   with heavy kicks. Heavy compression to make the kick punch, plus distortion
#   or bit-crushing for grit. Dark atmospheres and MINIMAL melodic content, so
#   the focus stays on energy. Reverb and delay for space and tension.
#   Repetitive, hypnotic structures with EVOLVING LAYERS.
#
# The last line is the one render_techno misses, and it is the difference
# between a loop and a set. So the core patterns keep their mod(t, cycle) --
# that is the hypnosis -- and each LAYER gets a gate on absolute time. The same
# eight bars come round and round while what is playing over them changes.
#
# A mix series like this runs long and moves in blocks rather than verses, so
# the schedule is in 16-bar blocks and reads as a set list rather than a song
# form: things arrive, sit, and leave.

# One gate expression per layer, over absolute time: the union of the blocks it

# The schedule is expressed as a POSITION through the set, not a block number.
#
# Written against absolute block indices it only worked at one length. A
# two-minute render is five blocks, so every layer scheduled from block 5
# onwards -- toms, ride, and the acid line that carries the only melody --
# never played at all, and hate_gate returned an empty string, which ffmpeg
# rejects with "undefined constant or missing '(' in ''". A silent layer and a
# broken filter, from the same cause.
#
# Position is 0.0 at the first block and 1.0 at the last, so a set thins and

  # HATE_ARRIVED plays every block fully arrived, for a caller rendering a
  # sample rather than a set. A short render cannot express the arc: blocks are
  # its only resolution, so two blocks means positions 0.0 and 1.0 and nothing
  # between, and the first half of the piece is the three ambient layers alone.

# a different vocabulary (blocks and an arc position rather than sections and
# bars) and emits a different filter (an `enable` expression built from
# `between` terms rather than a chain of `volume` stages).
#
# Both are good. Neither knows the other exists, which is the fork the genre
# work is supposed to be closing: `techno_bed_part!` above is the same story for
# the sampled bed, a second implementation of what build_sample_loop_filter
# does. The measurable form is in test_genre_renderers_reach_of_the_shared_spine,
# which records what each renderer reaches and fails if any of them reaches
# less. Merging the two arrangements is a real change to how every techno set
# sounds and is not something to do quietly at the end of a refactor -- but the
# duplication is now written down where the next person will find it, rather
# than being discoverable only by reading both renderers side by side.
