  # 0:36 to 0:46. The operator gave 0:35-0:45 and then asked for the noise at
  # the front taken out; measured, the first second of that window is a thin
  # lead-in -- -27 dB overall and -41 dB below 500 Hz, against -16 once the
  # passage proper enters at 1.0s. Moving the window one second later starts at
  # full energy and reads slightly cleaner harmonically too (G minor fit 0.836
  # against 0.813). Still 10 seconds, still 4 bars at 96.
  #
  # Note for the next time this comes up: the complaint was "screaming", but
  # nothing in this window is bright -- the band above 3 kHz never rises above
  # -38 dB anywhere in it. What was audible as harsh was a quiet, thin entry,
  # not a loud one, so looking for high-frequency energy would have found
  # nothing and concluded there was no problem.
  #
  # Original note, still true of the boundary: the detector had picked
  # 13.88s off an energy step and was wrong: it found where the spoken
  # intro stopped, which is not the same thing as where the passage worth
  # sampling starts. The measurements side with the operator -- this section
  # reads G minor at a Krumhansl fit of 0.813, against 0.27 for the detector's
  # cut, on a clean chroma (G, then Bb / Ab / Eb / D / F, a G minor scale).
  #
  # 10 seconds is 4 bars at 96 BPM. It contains no onsets at all -- a sustained
  # melodic passage rather than a rhythmic loop -- which is why onset-based
  # tempo detection reports nothing for it, and why bar arithmetic against a
  # known-good boundary is the only honest way to get a tempo here.
  #
  # Low end left flat: see the note above, this one does not need correcting.

  # of music in the same bar.
  #
  # render_dilla.rb's harmonic guard already argues exactly this ("there is no

  # it from whether the loop's key is READABLE. This loop reads Eb major at fit
  # 0.79 -- legible, so the guard concluded it could transpose the pads to match
  # and play them. Legibility is the wrong question for a record that has already
  # stated the chords; the right one is whether anything needs adding, and only
  # the crate knows that.
  #
  # Per record, not a mode. The other loops here want their progressions.

  # best, tempo 114 at 61% on-grid against a 20% baseline, D major at 0.697.
  #
  # 114 rather than 120, decided by measurement rather than by preference. The
  # self-similarity peak sat at exactly 2.00s, which is one bar at 120 and not
  # at 114, so the two analyses disagreed. Looping each candidate and comparing
  # the last 100ms against the first settles it: 8.421s (114) rejoins itself at
  # -1.1 dB, 8.000s (120) at -8.6 dB. The 2.00s peak was a sub-bar repeat inside
  # the material, not the bar length -- worth remembering, because
  # self-similarity finds the shortest thing that repeats, which is not
  # necessarily the musical unit.

  # Arat Swost Wolet, Ethiopian. 4 bars from 11.430s of the slowed copy.
  #
  # The de-vocaled stem, not the record: samples/arat_swost_wolet_slow.wav is
  # demucs's no_vocals output played at 0.8x, which the commit that added it does
  # not say and the audio does. Measured against the separated stems, on the
  # frames where the vocal sings the mix sits +4.90 dB above no_vocals and this
  # file sits -1.09 dB; on the frames where it is silent this file matches
  # no_vocals to +0.10 dB. So the singer is out, which is what makes it usable
  # as a bed under the engine's own harmony rather than a second tune.
  #
  # 84 BPM, decided by self-similarity rather than by onset spacing, which
  # disagreed. Onset gaps put it at 86.1; the repeat structure puts the bar at
  # 2.8575s and finds it again at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 bars -- five multiples of one
  # grid, which onset spacing cannot fake. 11.43s is 4 bars at 84. Its
  # self-repetition is 0.969, the cleanest in the rack by a distance (lo_borges,
  # previously the best, reads 0.654).
  #
  # A minor at a Krumhansl fit of 0.687, the strongest reading of anything here
  # except semua_untuk_mu.
  #
  # Known and not fixed: the loop does not rejoin cleanly. Its tail is about
  # 12 dB below its head, at EVERY candidate window on the grid, so it is the
  # phrase and not the cut -- the figure ends quiet. Expect an audible dip at
  # the seam and reach for LOOP_DELAY_BEATS or a crossfade if it matters. The
  # window at 11.430s was chosen because it has the best self-repetition and the
  # equal-best rejoin of the thirteen tried; bar 0 is within noise of it.

  # is far more bass-forward than anything else in the rack (four_seven -4.9,
  # nightbus -10.3, lo_borges -6.6) -- this record brings a lot of its own low
  # end. But raw numbers have already proved a poor predictor of render
  # behaviour here, so these are a starting point to check in a render and not a

# --- sample loop excitation ---------------------------------------------------
#
# Measured on the two registered loops (mono, 44.1k, banded against each one's
# own loudest band):
#
#   four_seven   sub -4.0  low +0.0  lomid -6.9  mid -15.6  hi -39.9  air -52.7
#   semua 35-45  sub -7.3  low +0.0  lomid -9.5  mid -20.0  hi -32.6  air -33.7
#
# four_seven's -39.9/-52.7 is a cliff, not a rolloff: there is essentially no
# content above 3 kHz. That matters because the only high-frequency stage in
# this filter is a LOWPASS at 11 kHz -- it has nothing to remove, and no stage
# anywhere in the sample path puts anything back. An EQ shelf cannot help
# either; you cannot boost what is not there.
#
# The content has to be synthesised from the harmonics of what IS present,
# which is what an exciter does: split the signal, drive one copy into a
# non-linearity, high-pass the result so only the newly generated harmonics
# survive, and blend that under the dry. (Aural Exciter / parallel saturation;
# see Sound On Sound on restoring HF in pitch-shifted samples.)
#
# Character picks which harmonics get generated, and it is the "older or more
# modern" dial:
#   even  x + k*x*|x|   2nd/3rd order, tube and transformer bloom -- rounder,
#                       sits behind the beat, reads as older.
#   odd   tanh(d*x)     odd-order, console and transistor clipping -- harder
#                       and more present, reads as modern.
#
# Off by default: it changes the sound of every registered loop, and the right
# amount is per-sample. SAMPLE_EXCITE=0.3 is a sensible starting point for
# four_seven; a sample that already has air needs far less or none.
