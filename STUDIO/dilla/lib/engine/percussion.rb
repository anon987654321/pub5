#
# Synthesised percussion one-shots: rim, clap, tabla, tambourine, woodblock, agogo.
#
# Part of the dilla engine, split out of dilla.rb. Defines methods and
# constants at top level exactly as it did there; dilla.rb requires the
# parts in the file's original order, because several constants are
# computed at load time from ones declared above them.

# Percussion belongs to the idiom, not to every track alike.
#
# woodblock and agogo fired OUTSIDE the family check, at a flat probability, on
# every step of every track in the catalogue. A Detroit kit, an LA kit and a
# techno kit all got the same woodblock-and-agogo sprinkle laid over them, and
# the operator heard exactly that -- "the redundant drum beat with agogo, not
# the new ones we designed". The feels were driving kicks, snares, hats and
# ghosts correctly; this layer was painting over the difference.
#
# Each feel names its own vocabulary and rate. 0 means the instrument is not
# part of that idiom: techno has no agogo, Detroit has no glitch stab. A feel
# with no entry keeps the old rates, so nothing that already sounded right
# changes.
# The vocabulary is what these producers actually played, and it is short.
#
# A Dilla or Slum Village kit is kick, snare, rimshot, clap, closed and open
# hat, and ghost snares. That is the whole list. Tambourine, agogo, woodblock
# and tabla are general-MIDI world percussion; neither Dilla nor the LA beat
# scene used them, and sprinkling them over a Detroit pattern is what made a
# demo full of new drum designs still sound like the old one.
#
# A first pass removed agogo and woodblock and left tambourine at 0.055, which
# was the same mistake wearing a different instrument. Everything outside the
# list is 0 now.
#
# rim stays because a rimshot is a hiphop sound and Dilla used one constantly.
# glitch stays on the LA and techno feels only, where a stab is idiomatic;
# Detroit gets none.
# Kick, snare/clap, hi-hat, ghost. That is the kit.
#
# Operator direction, and it is what the records are: a Dilla or Slum Village
# bar has a kick, a snare or clap, closed and open hats, and ghost snares
# underneath. Nothing else. Tambourine, agogo, woodblock and tabla are
# general-MIDI world percussion nobody in this lineage played, and rim and
# glitch are the same argument one step quieter -- an ornament arriving on top
# of a groove that should be carrying itself.
#
# Every rate is 0 for these three feels, so the eclectic layer contributes
# nothing and the drums are the drums. Drive and groove come from the kit and
# the microtiming, not from adding instruments. Any feel not listed keeps the
# old rates, so nothing else in the catalogue changes.

# name a rate explicitly in PERC_VOCAB to get one back.

# Struck objects, built the way struck objects actually behave.

# Every voice below used to be white noise or plain sines under one exponential
# decay, and that is audibly not what a drum is. Three things separate a
# synthesised hit from a sampled one, and all three are cheap to fix:
#
#   BAND LIMITING. Raw noise and raw squares carry energy past Nyquist, which
#   folds back down as inharmonic aliasing. It is the single most "cheap
#   digital" artefact there is. Everything here is filtered.
#
#   INHARMONICITY. A struck bar or bell rings at ratios that are NOT integers --
#   a real cowbell is nothing like 1:1.5, and an agogo at exactly 3:2 reads as
#   two oscillators rather than one object. The ratio tables below are
#   stretched deliberately, and higher modes decay faster, which is the physics:
#   short wavelengths lose energy to the mounting first.
#
#   A STRIKE. Every real percussion hit begins with a broadband contact noise
#   before the body speaks. Without it a modal ring sounds like a synth pad
#   with a fast attack, because that is exactly what it is.
#
# Deterministic per voice: the seeds are fixed, so a kit is the same kit twice.

# Two-pole resonant bandpass, transposed direct form II. Used to band-limit
# noise into a formant rather than letting it alias across the whole spectrum.
