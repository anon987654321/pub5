# Synth patches: the catalogue, the pools they group into, and the selection
# that picks one. These were patch_catalog.rb, patch_pools.rb and

# in both directions, and none of them a namespace: every method here lands on

# Rich synth patch catalog — GM programs, optional external sf2, native fallback timbres,
# and per-patch post-FX chains (tremolo/LFO/filter/delay) applied at render time.

  # ---------------------------------------------------- the famous machines
  #
  # Six patches that people can name. Each is a General MIDI voice reshaped into
  # the sound the real instrument is remembered for -- not the instrument, which
  # would need its oscillators, but the fingerprint: what the filter did, what
  # the chorus did, where the harmonics sat.
  #
  # The fingerprint is usually one or two things, and they are usually not the
  # oscillators. A Juno-106 is a fairly ordinary single-oscillator synth wearing
  # a famous chorus; a Minimoog is remembered for a filter and for three
  # oscillators that would not stay in tune with each other. Reproduce those and
  # most of the character follows.

  # MINIMOOG. Three oscillators, never quite in tune with one another, into a
  # 24 dB-per-octave ladder filter with a resonance that thickens rather than
  # whistles. The bass on Thriller.
  #
  # The detuning is the point and is why a Moog bass sounds enormous from one
  # note: three saws a few cents apart beat against each other, and the beating
  # is heard as weight. Here that is a short chorus with almost no modulation --
  # a fixed detune rather than a moving one -- and the ladder is a steep lowpass
  # with a resonant lift sitting on top of the cutoff.

  # they say "Juno".
  #

  # bucket-brigade line is an analogue delay with its own noise floor. Clean

  # had nothing named for it, so a track reaching for that sound landed on a
  # Rhodes and a supersaw.
  #
  # These are the instruments, not transcriptions: what separates that record
  # from generic downtempo is that its pads are bucket-brigade chorus rather
  # than digital, its strings are a divide-down ensemble rather than sampled
  # strings, and its top end is FM bell rather than a filtered saw.

  # JUNO-106 held pad, the bed the whole record sits on. Two chorus stages
  # rather than one: the giveaway of a bucket-brigade line is that it detunes
  # unevenly and carries its own noise, which one clean chorus cannot fake.

# Process.pid in the seed makes every render pick different patches, which is
# good for a stream that should not repeat itself and fatal for measurement:
# two renders differing only in one switch also differ in their entire synth
# voicing, so any A/B between them compares two variables and attributes the
# result to one. Large effects survive that noise; small ones do not, and
# several comparisons in this engine's history were probably reading patch
# variance rather than the change under test.
#
# RENDER_SEED pins it. Set it and renders are reproducible and comparable;
# leave it unset and the old per-process variation is unchanged.
