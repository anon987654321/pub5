# Drum DNA cycled each stream slot (preset grid + pocket set + sample kit).
# Applied after style force so DRUM_PRESET locks cannot pin dilla_slight forever.
# Soulful hip-hop only — no boom_808 / industrial / hard-trap rotation.
# The kits every stream and every demo track draws from.
#
# This was eight entries, all boom-bap, every one wonky: "0" -- so the eleven
# Flying Lotus presets in DRUM_PRESETS (wonky_abstract, wonky_cosmogramma,
# wonky_zodiac, wonky_burst, wonky_warp and the rest), the WONKY_DRUM_OVERLAY
# switch, and the whole learn-wonky command that transcribes a grid from a
# record, were unreachable from anything that actually renders. The presets
# existed and nothing could pick them. A demo of eight tracks came out
# boom-bap eight times, by construction rather than by choice.
#
# Five Wonky entries added. They are placed at odd indices so a run of
# consecutive tracks alternates rather than arriving in a block, since the
# rotation is indexed by track number.
#
# The pockets differ from the boom-bap half on purpose. wonky_abstract and
# wonky_burst are busier and want the straighter pocket under them; dilla_drunk
# with a Wonky grid on top is two kinds of drunk at once.
