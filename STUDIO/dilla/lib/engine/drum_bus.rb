# Drum bus routing: Wonky dual bus, ducking, field layer, drop bars.
#
# Part of the dilla engine, split out of dilla.rb. Defines methods and
# constants at top level exactly as it did there; dilla.rb requires the
# parts in the file's original order, because several constants are
# computed at load time from ones declared above them.

# "All his drums are dirty as fuck, sans the kick" -- and the cymbals in
# particular are swished through phaser and flanger until they are soupy rather
# than crisp.
#
# The dual-bus split already separates exactly the right things: the sub bus is
# the kick, the top bus is hats, snare and cymbals. So the dirt goes on the top
# branch and the kick stays untouched, which is the distinction being described
# rather than an approximation of it. Applying this to the whole kit would
# smear the one element that has to stay solid.
#
# Order matters: modulation BEFORE the EQ, so the phaser's own notches get
# shaped by the top-end lift rather than fighting it, and light saturation last
# so it thickens what the modulation produced.

# Named twice in the same discussion for a reason: when a hat lands on the same
# 16th as the kick, both fight for the same moment and the kick loses definition
# even though nothing overlaps in frequency. Ducking the top bus for a few tens
# of milliseconds lets the kick through cleanly and is inaudible as an effect --
# the hat is still there, it arrives a fraction behind.
#
# The dual-bus split makes this exact rather than approximate: the sub bus IS
# the kick, so it can key the compressor directly instead of using the whole kit
# as a trigger and ducking on every snare too.

#
# Measured against three J Dilla records (Time: The Donut of the Heart, Slum
# Village's World Full of Sadness, Jay Dee's La La La), octave-band energy
# relative to each file's own full-band level:
#
#            125Hz  250   500    1k    2k    4k    8k    tilt 125->4k
#   Time      -5.8  -8.1 -10.5 -11.9 -11.4 -15.1 -20.7   -1.86 dB/oct
#   Sadness   -3.5  -8.9 -12.7 -14.7 -15.9 -17.1 -19.6   -2.72
#   La La La  -2.2  -9.0 -14.4 -15.7 -16.1 -15.2 -17.5   -2.60
#   engine    -3.1  -5.1 -10.0 -15.1 -21.2 -27.5 -32.8   -4.88
#
# The engine falls roughly twice as fast: 12 dB darker at 4 kHz and 12-15 dB at
# 8 kHz than any of the three. It also carries 3-4 dB MORE at 250 Hz. Dark and
# congested at once, which is what "overdrive sound, pads not nice" describes.
#
# Caveat kept deliberately: the engine figure is an instrumental 8-bar sketch
# and the records are full mastered tracks with vocals and leads that carry
# their own top end. A render WITH a rap vocal measures -3.66 dB/oct -- closer,
# still steeper than all three. So content explains part of the gap and not all
# of it.
#
# The default is unchanged at 3400. PAD_LP exists so the number can be tested
# against those references instead of argued about; moving the default is a tone
# decision and belongs to the operator.
#
# A/B'd immediately after adding it, and the answer was NOT what the comment
# above would lead you to expect: PAD_LP=3400 against PAD_LP=7000 produces
# different files (different checksums, the override is definitely read) whose
# octave-band energy is identical to 0.1 dB at every band. The pad bus
# does not carry enough of the mix's top end for its bandwidth to register.
#
# So the darkness is not here. What the same measurement did find: every sampled
# bed is lowpassed between 5200 and 6000 Hz by its TRACK_SAMPLE_LOOPS entry,
# while all three reference records hold real energy at 8 kHz (-17.5 to -20.7
# relative). And the source material can carry it -- kembara_rindu's own loop.wav
# measures -2.54 dB/oct with 4 kHz at -17.8, which is La La La's -2.60 and -15.2
# almost exactly. The crates are not the limit; the per-loop lp is.
