#
# Smooth meant no grit: the bit-crusher gone, its harmonic density replaced by
# parallel compression. Hard means more impact, which is a transient question,
# not a distortion one. The two ask for different things and both can hold --
# what you cannot have is grit and impact at once, because quantisation noise
# sits on top of the attack and masks it.
#
# The click band is high-passed before it is compressed, so the fast attack
# works on stick and beater noise instead of being triggered by kick
# fundamental -- a full-band fast compressor ducks the whole kit every time the
# kick lands, which reads as pumping rather than punch. Blended under, so the
# body of the hit is untouched.
#
# 55 Hz is weight and 3.2 kHz is where a snare reads as crack. Both narrow, so
# they add impact at the two frequencies that carry it rather than making the
# whole kit louder, which the master stage would only take back out.

# So the loudest thing in the mix is mono, and the stereo thing is underneath
# it -- which is why the finished master reads as mono (-46 to -65 dB side/mid)
# while the harmonic stem on its own is a healthy -7, and real records sit at
# -3 to -6.
#
# Widening above 250 Hz only. The kick and the low body stay where they are,
# because low-frequency stereo is what mono_bass exists to undo and moving it
# would fight the last stage of every rack.

# On by default now, at a third of the available range.
#
# The stage below is careful, measured work -- haas rather than stereowiden
# because every sample in the kit is mono, above 250 Hz only so the kick keeps
# its attack -- and it defaulted to 0, which made all of it an anull. The kit
# rendered dead centre and the operator heard exactly that: a mix that wants
# each sound brought out into a field instead of stacked on one point.
#
# 0.35 rather than more: at that setting the haas delay is 4.1 ms left against
# 1.1 ms right, well inside the ~30 ms fusion limit where the ear reads
# direction rather than echo, and the side gain lifts 1.21x. Wider starts to
# hollow the centre, and mono_bass folds the low end back at the end of the

# would leave the kit thinner than before rather than smoother.

# Parallel compression is the documented way to get the density back: a hard-
# compressed copy blended under the untouched one raises the body and the tail
# while the dry path keeps its transients. Standard practice on this genre's
# drum bus, and it is why the split exists here rather than a single heavier
# compressor, which would flatten the attack the crusher was never touching.
