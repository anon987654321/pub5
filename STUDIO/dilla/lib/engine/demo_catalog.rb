# computed at load time from ones declared above them.

# Pad / arp / voicing pools for demo-all — distinct sonic identity per slot
# (stream DNA alone keeps stack_soul+held+jonas_v and reads as "one song").
# Rhodes / Prophet first — glass/vapor/neon are spice, not the main course.

# This was fourteen slots naming nine voices, and three of them -- stack_rhodes,
# stack_prophet, stack_soul -- filled more than half. Measured across all 86
# tracks, 13 of the 37 defined pad voices were ever selected and 24 never were,
# including every one of pad_dilla, pad_wonky and pad_royksopp: voices named for
# the producers this engine models, which had never been rendered once.
#
# Widened to reach all of them. The repeats that remain are deliberate -- the
# Rhodes and Prophet stacks are the house sound and should still come up most
# often -- but a catalogue of 86 pieces now draws on 37 voices rather than
# leaning on three.
#
# stack_world, stack_giga, stack_yamaha and stack_vintage are layer stacks
# rather than single voices, so they arrive with their own internal blend; they
# are spaced out rather than clustered, because two thick stacks in consecutive
# slots read as one long stack.

#
# STREAM_ROTATION is the 69-track stream order. It misses two catalogues:
# GENERATED_STYLES (11 generative modes — major_third_cycle_full, negative_harmony,
# tritone_sub … resolved by dilla_progression rather than a CHORD_PROGRESSIONS
# lookup) and four ARTIST_VERIFIED_PROGRESSIONS turnarounds the rotation never
# reaches. Union is 84, and that is what the demo should represent — a demo of
# the stream order alone understates what the engine knows.
#
# DEMO_CATALOG=stream narrows back to the broadcast rotation.
# Every table that decides what the engine can reach, and what it leaves out.
#
# A capability nothing selects is a capability nothing tests, which is how a pad
# patch carried an out-of-range filter value for months without anyone hearing
# it: the voice was defined, no rotation named it, and the broken chain never
# ran. The audit lists what is defined against what is reachable, so that gap is
# a number somebody sees rather than something discovered by ear.
#
# Deliberately reports rather than enforces. A few entries SHOULD be
# unreachable -- a hard-trap kit has no place in this catalogue -- and a check
# that fails the build on those would get switched off. A number that moves
# in the wrong direction is the useful signal.

# Join the parts into one wav. `-c copy` is worth keeping -- it is near-instant on
# 84 tracks where a re-encode is minutes -- but it cannot be trusted on its own,
# because on a codec mismatch it does not fail. It writes the wrong stream into a
# WAV container and exits 0, so the rescue that used to guard this never fired and
# the demo shipped a file that opens nowhere. Check the parts first, then copy.
# Crossfade the parts into one piece rather than butting them together.

# The concat demuxer joins sample to sample. That is right for one recording cut
# into parts and wrong for eighty-six separate pieces in eighty-six keys: every
# join is a hard edge, and a demo meant to be listened through end to end reads
# as a folder of clips instead.
