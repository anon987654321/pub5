  # Kick on 1, snare on 2, kick on the "and" of 3, snare on 4 -- steps 0, 4, 10,
  # 12 on this grid. That displaced second kick is the whole genre: it is what
  # makes the bar roll forward instead of marching, and moving it onto 8 turns
  # liquid into halftime.
  #
  # Liquid rather than neurofunk or jump-up, which matters for what is NOT here.
  # No chopped amen, no snare rushes, no double-time fills. The kit stays out of
  # the way and the harmony carries the track -- the style is defined by lush
  # Rhodes and strings over a break that barely changes, which is why the
  # variations below move ghosts and hats and almost never touch the anchors.
  #
  # Hats roll in 16ths. At 174 bpm a 16th is 86 ms, so a straight roll reads as
  # continuous motion rather than as separate hits, and that shimmer is what
  # people mean by "rolling".
  #
  # Ghosts sit between the snares, quiet, on the 16ths either side of the
  # backbeat. They are the difference between a programmed break and one that
  # sounds played.

  # ONE DROP. Roots reggae, the Hugh Mundell / Augustus Pablo end of it.
  #
  # The defining feature is a hole, not a hit: step 0 is empty. Kick and snare
  # land together on beat 3 (step 8) and the bar "drops" onto it. Every other
  # pattern in this file anchors the downbeat, so this is the one that must not
  # -- put a kick on 0 and it stops being a one drop and becomes a slow
  # rocksteady, which is a different genre.
  #
  # The rim/side-stick doubling the snare on 8 is the reggae sound rather than a
  # backbeat crack; it is voiced through the ghost lane because that is the
  # quiet lane this engine already has.
  #
  # Hats on the offbeats only. The skank -- the guitar/organ chop on the "and"
  # of every beat -- is harmonic, not percussive, so it is not here; it belongs
  # to the pad layer and is what a future DUB rack would carve around.

  # Detroit stumble — the kick is the erratic one.
  #
  # dilla_canon anchors every kick on 0 and the late 3 and lets snare and hat
  # carry the lean. The microtiming literature describes the opposite balance:
  # "21st Century Funk" (Academia) analyses Dilla's early beats and finds the
  # KICK the unstable element against stable snare and hi-hat, with 10 of 13
  # kick notes in one measure falling outside typical metric locations. Ethan
  # Hein's Ableton analysis of "Get Dis Money" agrees on the other two: the
  # backbeat sits a touch EARLY and the hats late, and because the ear orients
  # on the loud backbeat, everything else is heard as dragging behind it.
  #
  # So here the snare never moves — [4, 12] in every single bar, deliberately
  # repeated rather than varied — and the hats stay an even eighth grid. All of
  # the variation is in the kick, which lands somewhere different every bar.
  # That is a stumble rather than a lean, and a stumble is what "tipsy" means.
  #
  # Timing, not grid: the early backbeat and late hat come from GROOVE_FEEL, the
  # same way dilla_canon's do. This table only says WHICH sixteenth, never how
  # far off it sits.

# Industrial techno, with variation, because techno_house has none.
#
# techno_house is the only feel in this table with a single kick pattern --
# kicks: [[0, 4, 8, 12]], one entry -- against four to ten everywhere else. Its
# own comment admits it. Every bar of every techno passage in the catalogue is
# therefore the identical four-on-the-floor, which is what "never repeat the
# same beat twice" is a complaint about, and it is where the drum morph was
# walking at the end of every piece.
#
# Four on the floor is the floor, not the ceiling. The variation is in what
# happens BETWEEN the kicks -- a ghost before the four, a late one pushing into
# the next bar, a doubled sixteenth -- so the pulse never moves and the bar is
# never the same twice.
#
# Open hats sit on the offbeat, which is the lift of the genre: 2, 6, 10, 14
# against kicks on 0, 4, 8, 12. techno_house opened on 6 and 14 only, so half
# the lift was missing.

  # everywhere the backbeat is not. Grids are 16 sixteenths; swing and timing
  # come from the preset, not from here.
