# Part of the dilla engine, split out of dilla.rb. Defines methods and

# parts in the file's original order, because several constants are
# computed at load time from ones declared above them.

# --- phrase snapping ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# atempo can only fix a take that HAS a tempo. A freely-sung take has no
# periodic spacing to stretch onto a grid, and measuring this proved it: across
# source BPMs from 96 to 128 against a 92 BPM beat, gunnhild landed 31%, 20%,
# 19%, 18%, 25% and 14% of her onsets on the grid, against a ~20% random-phase
# baseline. Slowing her down made the alignment WORSE. There is no ratio that
# works because the thing a ratio scales -- the spacing between her syllables --
# is not constant in the first place.
#
# So place instead of stretch: cut the take at its sung lines and start each
# line on a grid line, letting the silence between lines absorb the drift. The
# alignment then comes from where each line BEGINS, which is what a listener
# hears as being on the beat, and no line is time-warped internally so the
# delivery inside it stays hers.

# Dead-on the grid is not the goal -- it is only the reference the lean is
# measured from. rap_vocal_pocket_nudge_sec already drags the whole vocal 3-4
# ticks of 96 PPQ behind the beat (20-27ms at 92), but that is one constant for
# the entire take. Dilla's feel is not constant; it wanders line to line, and
# the wander is the point. RAP_VOCAL_LEAN_MS sets the base drag, and each line
# is offset from it by a fixed walk.

# and a known slot, so stretching it onto the nearest whole number of grid
# units is a different operation from stretching the take -- it is what a
# DAW's warp markers do, and the reason they work on takes atempo cannot.

    # The vocal keys a duck on the beat. Both halves of this used to be one
    # fixed amix into a limiter, and that is why the voice came and went: the
    # weights are constant, so when the beat thickens the SUM rises, the limiter
    # pulls the whole sum down, and the vocal — the smaller part of it — goes
    # down with the beat. Thin the beat out again and the voice reappears. It
    # was never the vocal moving; it was the bed moving under a shared limiter.
    #
    # Turning the voice up is the wrong repair. Level is what drives the limiter,
    # so a louder vocal makes the pumping worse and adds the hardness that reads
    # as saturation. Ducking the bed instead makes room without adding level:
    # the sum gets quieter while the rap is going, so the limiter does less work
    # exactly when intelligibility matters most.
    #
    # Measured, not estimated: against a steady key at -30 dB threshold the bed
    # drops 4.50 dB at ratio 2, against 0.30 dB at ratio 1 and 7.40 dB at
    # ratio 6. Four and a half dB is the broadcast voiceover range — decisive
    # enough that the voice sits in front, short of the audible pump of a
    # dance-mix sidechain. A real vocal is intermittent where the test key was
    # steady, so that figure is the ceiling rather than the average.
    # 6 ms catches a syllable onset; 260 ms is longer than the gap
    # between words, so it rides a whole line rather than chattering between
    # them, which is the difference between presence and a tremolo.
