# computed at load time from ones declared above them.

# A sampled loop played with -stream_loop is bit-identical every repetition, and
# nothing acoustic repeats exactly. ORGANIC_VARY=1 pre-builds the bed as N
# separately-processed copies so each pass differs slightly in pitch, tone and
# start offset -- the thing that stops a loop sounding stapled to the grid.
#
# Deliberately small numbers: past a few cents the loop stops agreeing with the
# generated harmony, and past ~15ms the drums stop agreeing with themselves.
