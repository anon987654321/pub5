# Part of the dilla engine, split out of dilla.rb. Defines methods and
# constants at top level exactly as it did there; dilla.rb requires the
# parts in the file's original order, because several constants are
# computed at load time from ones declared above them.

# The bass gets its own bus rather than riding the harmonic one. It used to be
# mixed into the harmonic render, which is high-passed to keep pad mud out of
# the kick's way -- and that corner sits ABOVE the bass fundamental (roots land
# at 82-116 Hz), so the bass was filtered out of the mix it was supposed to
# anchor. That is also why the earlier attempts to fix it by raising BASS_VOL
# and lowering the harm corner never moved the master: the level was never the
# problem, the routing was. The engine's own quality gate had been rejecting
# every take on "sub=boost_sub (low-mid -9.51 dB)" because of it.
# Per-channel analog treatment, applied BEFORE the buses are summed.
#
# The master already runs sonitex tape and an analog chain, but that stage only
# ever sees the sum. A desk does not work that way: every channel saturates on
# the way in, so each source generates its own harmonics first and those
# harmonics then intermodulate in the bus. One saturator on the sum cannot
# produce that, because by the time it runs the sources no longer exist
# separately.
#
# Character differs per bus because the sources do. Drums take the hardest
# drive -- transients are what saturation flatters. Bass takes the least: it is
# already the loudest thing in the low end and driving it turns definition into
# mud. Harmony sits between, where a little bloom thickens pads without
# blurring their attacks.
# 0.18. Per-bus colour plus the small phase offsets below, so the buses do not
# sum perfectly coherently. Off by default meant every bus summed like maths.
