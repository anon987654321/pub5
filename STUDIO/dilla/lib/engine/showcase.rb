# Part of the dilla engine, split out of dilla.rb. Defines methods and
# constants at top level exactly as it did there; dilla.rb requires the
# parts in the file's original order, because several constants are
# computed at load time from ones declared above them.

# Bare `ruby dilla.rb` (no args, no options) used to mean "continuous live
# stream" -- a `stream()` infinite loop needing afplay/ffplay to real
# speakers, which never terminates and can't run headless/over SSH. Sensible
# default instead: render a short demo.wav that actually showcases the
# engine's range (every named TRACK_PRESETS style, a few bars each,
# concatenated), matching "convention over configuration" -- no ENV knobs
# required to get a real, finite result. `ruby dilla.rb stream` still gives
# the old continuous behavior explicitly for anyone at a machine with speakers.

# for a second render in the same process; a fresh interpreter per style sidesteps

# A continuous techno set instead of the hip-hop rotation.

# is the right shape for a catalogue of progressions and the wrong one for a
# techno set, where the whole point is that it does not stop between pieces.
#
# STREAM_STYLE=techno routes each iteration through render_hate_techno instead,
# and advances a block counter across iterations so the set keeps evolving
# rather than restarting its arrangement every few minutes. Each pass renders a
# few minutes, plays them, and the next pass picks up further along the shape --
# the layer schedule reads a position from 0 to 1, so a stream that has been
# running for an hour is deep into the set rather than back at the intro.

# playback starts quickly and edits to the engine take effect within one block.
