# Tape and console on the master: hysteresis, tilt, mono bass, drone, tape stop.
#
# Part of the dilla engine, split out of dilla.rb. Defines methods and
# constants at top level exactly as it did there; dilla.rb requires the
# parts in the file's original order, because several constants are
# computed at load time from ones declared above them.

# Real tape hysteresis, applied to the finished master.
#
# Everything else in this engine that saturates is memoryless -- output is a
# function of the current sample alone, so the transfer curve is a single line
# and the same input always gives the same output. Tape is path-dependent: the
# curve is a loop, and the output at a given level differs depending on whether
# the signal arrived there rising or falling. Verified on a sine through this
# model: at input 0.0 the output is 0.0 on the way up and +0.46 on the way down.
# No waveshaper produces that at any setting, which is the difference between
# adding harmonics and sounding like a machine.
#
# Ruby per-sample DSP is slow, so this is opt-in and reports its cost.
# Default 0.16 (drive 1.48), not 0. A Jiles-Atherton magnetisation model sat
# in lib/ fully built and switched off, so nothing rendered by this engine
# had ever been through it. Tape character was being asked of an EQ curve.

# the perceived weight goes with the brightness. A tilt pivots: the bottom rises
# by the same amount the top falls, so the mix reads as relaxed rather than
# merely dull, and the loudness barely moves.
#
# Two shelves around a pivot rather than one filter, because that is what a tilt
# is. Pivot at 700 Hz: low enough that it does not thin the body, high enough

# lowpass ~3.6 kHz" (Camel, Massage Situation), "high shelf rolled ~9 kHz"

# lowpass warmth", and bergen_local's "master LP 2.7-3.1 kHz". Nothing in this
# engine implemented it; the only top-end control was VINYL.
#
# Those numbers are NOT taken literally. A brickwall lowpass at 3.2 kHz makes
# a record sound like a telephone -- real Donuts and Camel masters have
# cymbals well above 10 kHz -- so the figure is describing the treatment of
# the sampled bed, or the perceived centre of the rolloff, not a filter on the

#   without making it calmer, which is why cutting only here never fixes the
