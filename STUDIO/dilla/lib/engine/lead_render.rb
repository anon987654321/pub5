# something struck, where each event decays, and its whole character is that the
# decay darkens. On a sustained pad it would be a dull filter, and on a full
# mix it would gate the whole arrangement against the kick.
#
# Measured on a decaying pluck: over the decay the 4-12 kHz band falls 17.5 dB
# further than the 200-800 Hz band does, against 0.4 dB for the same note without
# it. That gap is the device.

# VOICE_STACK=n — the lead played by n voices at once.
#
# Not Hocket, and the difference is the point. Hocket splits notes BETWEEN
# voices, so each plays part of the line and the ear reassembles it. This has
# every voice play ALL of it, differing in register, tuning and timbre -- an
# ensemble playing together rather than passing a melody around. A section, not
# a hocket.
#
# The two compose: HOCKET=3 VOICE_STACK=2 gives three voices each doubled.
#
# Off by default. It multiplies the lead's density, which is the loudest
# structural change available to this part.
# Two voices by default, not one.
#
# This returned early at VOICE_STACK=1, so the P_4L-shaped stack -- the
# ringtone.tools idea this file is built on -- never ran in a normal render. The
# operator asked for those leads "on top in the same scale and harmonies", and
# they were switched off.
#
# Two rather than more, and it is the count that makes it safe. SEMITONE_PLAN's
# fifths row is [0, 12, 7, 19, -12, 24, 7], so a two-voice stack takes [0, 12]:
# the added voice is exactly an octave up. An octave is in key against any chord
# in any scale, so "on top" is literal and the harmony cannot be wrong. Three
# voices would add the +7 fifth, which is diatonic against most degrees and a
# tritone against the seventh -- a musical decision rather than a safe default.
#
# VOICE_STACK=1 restores the single voice.
