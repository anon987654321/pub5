# ffmpeg's aecho in_gain scales the DRY signal, not only the echo tail. A patch

#
# That was diagnosed once, in the comment on fm_bowed_pad, and fixed only there.
# A census of the file found 78 of 133 aecho uses still sitting below 0.5 in_gain:
# 45 in 0.4-0.5, 27 in 0.3-0.4, six below 0.3. So most patches were quietly

# them — a 30.9 dB spread across the warm role, between patches that rotate
# against each other.
#
# The fix is the one that comment prescribes: keep in_gain near unity and carry
