# --- Singers Unlimited chop pads -------------------------------------------
# The pad bed built from CHOPS of a real Singers Unlimited vocal stem instead
# of synth pads (classic Dilla move: chop the vocal-harmony record). Per pad
# event, a phrase chop is repitched via asetrate (true tape/chipmunk repitch,
# artifacts intended) to the chord root plus up to two upper chord tones, so
# the chop harmonizes itself to the progression regardless of the source key.
# Default OFF (SINGERS_CHOP_PADS=1 enables). When this succeeds it replaces the
# synth pad stack *entirely* -- so with it on by default the real pads (the
# fluidsynth stack, the patch catalog, PAD_VOICE, every voice-leading decision)
# never reached the mix at all; the chords you heard were repitched vocal chops.
# It is an effect, not the pad engine, so it has to be opted into. Enable with
# SINGERS_CHOP_PADS=1, which needs a stem:
#   ruby dilla.rb rap-vocal ingest singers_unlimited <youtube-url-or-path>

#
# render_singers_chop_pads above is varispeed tape: atrim a phrase, asetrate it

# it reads as a bed. This path spectrally resynthesizes instead — magnitudes
# kept, phase discarded — so the ensemble stops being four people singing and
# becomes a sustained harmonic instrument that still carries their voicing.
# That is the whole point: the melody is not played BY a synth, the choir IS
# the synth.
#
# Phase randomization is the Paulstretch core (huge windows, random phase,
# heavy overlap-add). ffmpeg has no paulstretch filter and no rubberband here,
# so afftfilt supplies the phase discard and atempo=0.5 supplies the exact 2x
# stretch that holds pitch. Measured on the real sample: band energy at 200/400/
# 900/2500 Hz tracks the dry signal within 0.3 dB of a uniform 6 dB drop, so the
# voicing survives intact and only the level moves — hence the fixed +6 dB.
