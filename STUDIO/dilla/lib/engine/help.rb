                                   tuning and timbre (Hocket splits notes

                                   The macro picks a MODEL (tine glass analog
                                   string reed choir blade figure) and the model
                                   picks a patch from the 212 in the catalogue.
  LPG=1                          Buchla low-pass gate on the lead: it darkens
                                   as it decays, which is what makes a note read
                                   as struck. Measured, the 4-12k band falls
                                   17.5 dB further than the body over a decay.
                                   LPG_BLEND=1.0 (0 = plain VCA), LPG_DEPTH,

                                   drift, weight, air…) instead of by knobs.

    ARRANGEMENT AND BUS
      SECTION_LAYERS=1 (default)     Drums, bass and the sampled bed follow the
                                       section map; pads and texture play flat
      SECTION_LAYERS=full            The harmony bus LEAVES in the intro and in
                                       any breakdown long enough to read as one
                                       (8s+); shorter ones duck instead, because
                                       taking the loudest channel out for a bar
                                       three times in ninety seconds is a
                                       stutter, not a section. The analog pad and
                                       the vinyl/rumble texture get section
