# The routing spine: channels into buses into a master.
#
# dilla already builds exactly this shape and builds it by hand. render_dilla
# accumulates `filt` (a list of ffmpeg filter_complex clauses), `mix_labels` and
# `mix_weights`, joins them with amix, and appends the master chain -- roughly
# eighty lines of string assembly in which the routing decisions are literals
# scattered through conditionals. The other three renderers do not do it at all:
# render_techno, render_industrial and render_analog go straight to
# normalise_genre_master! and never see a bus, which is why the console strip in
# tape_master is reachable from render_dilla and from nothing else.
#
# This is not a new audio path. It emits the same filter_complex, and
# test_audio_graph.rb pins that against the string render_dilla would have
# produced for the same channels. It exists so that "route this to the drum bus"
# is a thing the engine can say, and so a genre can be a set of channel
# definitions rather than its own renderer.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT do:
#
#   - decide gains. Weights come from the caller, because the numbers currently
#     in render_dilla (0.68 chops, 0.72 sub, 0.75 padbed, 0.35 vinyl) were
#     tuned by ear against real material and are not this object's to invent.
#   - touch ffmpeg. It returns a string. Shelling out stays in shell.rb, which
#     is the one place that already knows about timeouts and SIGTTIN.
#   - reorder anything. Emission order follows insertion order, because amix
#     weights are positional and a reordered graph is a different mix.

  # input:  an ffmpeg input specifier -- "0:a", "[chops]", or a bare label.
  # chain:  filters applied to this source alone, in order, as strings.

  # bus:    which bus collects it.

  # amix's own defaults are wrong for a mix bus: duration=longest pads every
  # channel to the longest one, and normalize=1 silently rescales by input count
  # so adding a quiet channel drops everything else. render_dilla already passes
  # both explicitly; the spine keeps that rather than rediscovering it.

  # normalize=0 on all three of its amix calls, and measured against a 440Hz
  # reference that is 4.1 dB quieter than the same weights give under
  # normalize=0 (-21.07 against -16.94 RMS). Its bed then feeds a sidechain
  # compressor at -24dB, a tanh saturator and a compressor at -14dB, so the
  # difference is audible rather than bookkeeping.
  #
  # Passing the legacy string is how a migration proves parity first and changes
  # the sound second, as two decisions instead of one. It is not a default:
  # AMIX_OPTIONS is, and anything new gets the explicit form.
