# Melodic lead writing: voice leading, phrase shape, parallel-interval rejection.
#
# Part of the dilla engine, split out of dilla.rb. Defines methods and
# constants at top level exactly as it did there; dilla.rb requires the
# parts in the file's original order, because several constants are
# computed at load time from ones declared above them.

# Occasional lead bursts — not every chord gets an arp. When they fire, use
# intricate patterns (euclidean, fibonacci, wonky wobble, etc.) with
# call-and-response and patch-specific gate lengths.
# --- The counter-line -------------------------------------------------------
#
# A second tune that answers the chords, instead of a busier copy of them.
#
# What was wrong. Every other lead in this file is built by walking the list of
# pad events -- the chords. For each chord it takes that chord's notes, starts
# when the chord starts, and stops when the chord stops. So the lead played the
# same notes as the backing, at the same moment, only faster. That is not a
# second part. It is the first part again with more notes in it, and it buried
# the chords rather than answering them.
#
# What this does instead. It asks the chords only one question -- "what notes
# are allowed right now?" -- and decides everything else itself: when to come
# in, how long to hold, which way to move, and how far behind the beat to sit.
#
# The rules below are borrowed, not invented. Sources are named where they
# apply. Nothing here is a matter of taste that could not be checked.

# A step is a tone or less. Anything past a fifth is a jump too far to sing.

# and placed every note on an exact grid position, in a file named after the
# producer whose entire signature is that his parts do not.
#
# Sung and bowed lines drag: a voice takes time to speak and a bow takes time to
# bite, so they arrive after the note they are answering. Hence a base lag,
# plus a small per-note wobble so no two entries are identical.
