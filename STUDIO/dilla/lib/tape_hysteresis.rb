# Jiles-Atherton tape hysteresis, plus Ornstein-Uhlenbeck wow and flutter.
#
# Why this exists when the engine already has saturation. Everything else here
# is memoryless: asoftclip, alimiter, a waveshaper -- output is a function of
# the current sample alone, so the same input value always gives the same output
# value and the transfer curve is a single line. Real tape is not like that. The
# magnetisation of the medium depends on its history, so the curve is a LOOP:
# the output at a given input differs depending on whether the signal is rising
# or falling into it. That path-dependence is why tape compresses a transient
# differently from a sustained tone, and it is the part a waveshaper cannot
# reach however carefully its curve is drawn.
#
# The model is Jiles-Atherton, solved with RK4, which is the standard treatment
# for ferromagnetic hysteresis and what open tape emulations use.
#
# Wow and flutter use an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process rather than summed sines. A
# capstan does not wander freely and it does not follow a fixed cycle -- it
# drifts and is pulled back toward centre. O-U is exactly that: a random walk
# with a restoring force. Summed sines never repeat either, but they are
# deterministic underneath, and the ear eventually finds the pattern.
