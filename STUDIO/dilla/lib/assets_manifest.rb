# The inputs a render names, and whether they are still there.
#
# A recipe can name a sample that is not on this machine. RELEASE.mp3's sidecar
# names EXTERNAL_KIT=03-soulful-vintage, which is not in the repository at all --
# it lives in a git clone under ~/.cache that nothing records the identity of --
# and SAMPLE_LOOP as an absolute path into samples/, where 46 of the files are
# untracked. Neither fact is discoverable from the manifest, and a render that
# cannot find a named input does not stop: it falls back, substitutes, and
# produces a perfectly good beat that is not the one the recipe describes.
#
# Two halves, and they answer different questions:
#
#   check_inputs!  did THIS run get what it asked for? Runs at startup, before
#                  a note is rendered, and refuses rather than substitutes.
#   verify         is the crate itself intact? Compares the recorded hashes
#                  against what is on disk, so a sample that was replaced,
#                  re-encoded or truncated is visible.
#
# The manifest is written by hand (`dilla assets record`) rather than on every
# render, because a manifest that updates itself records whatever happened
# instead of what was supposed to happen, and would have nothing to say the day
# a sample changes underneath a take.
