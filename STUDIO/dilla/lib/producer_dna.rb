    # dominant a dominant. The fifth is the note a piano player drops first
    # for exactly this reason, so it is dropped here instead and the trim
    # never fires. Order still matters: an interval smaller than one already
    # listed is an upper extension (see voice_extensions), so b9-then-13

    # is MICROTIMING_MS -- the snare arriving 10-28ms early, hats 12-32ms late,
    # kick almost on the grid -- measured in milliseconds, not in 16ths. Moving
    # the backbeat does not produce a drunk hip-hop beat, it produces a beat
    # that is not hip-hop. Character belongs in the kick placement, the ghosts,
    # and the swing; the backbeat is the thing the listener sets their clock by.
    #
    # humanize also stays in the references' 2-4 range. At 6 it stopped reading
    # as feel and started reading as an unsteady drummer.

    # Donuts-era Dilla: no hats at all. Half that record keeps time with the
    # sample's own noise and lets the kit be only kick and snare, which is why
    # those beats breathe where a hat pattern would tick.

  # ---- push pads -------------------------------------------------------------
  # Simple beats of the kind you get tapping pads: straight, sparse, no swing,
  # nothing clever. A deliberate counterweight to the rest of this table, which

  # Sometimes the sample is the idea and the kit only has to keep time under it,
  # and there was nothing here that would do that.
  #
  # humanize 1 rather than 0: dead-flat machine timing is its own effect, and a
  # single tick of movement is the difference between simple and sterile.

# got from a separated drum stem: kicks [0,3,6,10,13], ghost snares [7,15,10],

# [0,6,10] / [7] / nothing, because the dense version "sounded wrong".
#
# That judgement was made before WONKY_TOP_DIRT existed. Accounts of how these
# drums are built say the extra hits are meant to be dirty and half-buried --
# phased, flanged, crushed -- not clean kit hits. A dense grid of clean hits
# is busy; the same grid through the dirt may be the texture. Kept as a

  # A slash chord is its upper structure over a foreign bass, capped at the pad's
  # voice count -- so one voice has to go, and which one is the whole question.
  #
  # The rule was `.sort.uniq.first(5)`: trim from the top, on the reasoning that
  # the top voice is a padded octave doubling. That holds for a four-note template
  # padded up to five and fails for every five-note ninth voicing, where the top
  # voice IS the ninth the chord is named after. Measured before this change:
  # Cm9/Bb came out Bb2 C3 Eb3 G3 Bb3 -- a Cm7 over Bb, Bb doubled, no D anywhere
  # -- and Cmaj9/G lost its D, Gm9/G its A. Those spellings are most of
  # stepwise_bass, descending_bass_soul, chromatic_bass_walk and
  # pedal_dominant_hold, so the ninth that defines the sound was absent from the
  # progressions built entirely out of it.
  #
  # Drop what a player drops: first a voice doubling the bass's pitch class, then
  # the fifth, then the lowest inner voice. The bass and the top voice always
  # survive.
  #
  # root_pc has to be told, not guessed. Read off the lowest note it is only
  # the root in root position -- and the voicings that reach here
  # are routinely inverted. Abmaj9 arrives as C Eb G Ab Bb, so "lowest note" said
  # C, "the fifth above C" said G, and G is Ab's MAJOR SEVENTH: Abmaj9/F and
  # Ebmaj9/C were each losing the one interval that separates a maj9 from a 6/9,
