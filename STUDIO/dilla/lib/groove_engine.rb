  # with `s % 16`, and drum_pattern_pick returns a per-bar list. That is a
  # cross-rhythm INSIDE a bar, which is not the same thing as a polymeter, and
  # the difference is audible -- a figure that resets every bar agrees with the
  # downbeat every bar, however uneven it is within one.
  #
  # This indexes the pattern by the GLOBAL step instead, so an 11-step cycle
  # against a 16-step bar precesses and only comes back round to the downbeat
  # after lcm(11, 16) = 176 steps, or 11 bars.
  #
  # The gap this fills was a claim rather than a feature. producer_dna.rb's
  # wonky_cosmogramma preset says its hats are "a 3-step cycle against a 16-step
  # bar, so they only agree with the downbeat once every three bars" -- but its
  # pool holds one entry, [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15], so drum_pattern_pick returns the
  # identical list for every bar and the hats hit the downbeat in all of them.
  # That preset is left alone (nothing moves unless asked); POLYMETER_HATS=3 is
  # what the comment describes.
  #
  # pulses defaults to ONE hit per cycle, not one per position in it. "A 3-step
  # cycle" is a hit every third step -- [0, 3, 6, 9, ...] -- and the first cut of
  # this defaulted to `(0...cycle).to_a`, i.e. every residue, which matches every
  # step and fires continuously. It looked like a working polymeter in the code
  # and was a 16th-note roll in the output.
  #
  # Give pulses to spread more than one hit across the cycle with euclidean, so
  # POLYMETER_HATS=11 POLYMETER_PULSES=7 is the 7-against-11 that IDM uses.
  #
  # Capped at cycle - 1, not at cycle. euclidean(n, n) is every position by
  # definition, so a cycle filled to its own length has no gap in it, precesses
  # against nothing and is audible only as a 16th roll -- the same output as the
  # default bug above, reached by asking for too many pulses instead of too few.
