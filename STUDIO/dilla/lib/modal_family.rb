# Which progressions belong in the same rotation.
#
# The stream ran eight progressions — Dilla's own — because widening it meant
# key chaos: the catalogue spans 248 progressions across every mode, and putting
# Lydian next to Phrygian next to whole-tone has no centre. KeyLock removes that
# objection by bringing everything to one tonic, so the question becomes the
# narrower and more useful one: which progressions share a *scale*, not just a
# root.
#
# The collection is Bb Dorian/Aeolian — the bittersweet soul region, ♭3 ♭6 ♭7
# with the Dorian ♮6 available — plus the major third, because the parallel
# major is not a foreign key. Alternating Bb minor and Bb major is modal
# interchange, which is idiomatic to this music rather than a mistake; `e_major_third_rise`
# (Bbmaj7 Dm7 Gm7 Bb7) is Dilla's own and it is parallel major.

  # drops two of Dilla's eight; at 0.85 it still drops one; at 0.75 it admits 239
  # of 248 and has stopped filtering. 0.80 keeps all eight and excludes 45.
  #
  # Roots rather than full chord tones: an extension can borrow from outside the
  # collection for one chord without leaving the key, which is the whole point of
  # a borrowed dominant or a tritone sub. Where the *root* leaves, the progression
  # has actually modulated.

  # Widened outward from the core rather than replacing it —
  # DILLA_PROGRESSIONS_ONLY narrowing to Dilla's own was a deliberate choice
  # (2026-07-27), and this keeps those eight while admitting the rest of the
  # catalogue that belongs in the same key and mode. MODAL_ROTATION=0 restores
  # the narrow pool exactly.
  # `always` names progressions that skip the fit test entirely.
  #
  # The test is diatonic: it asks what share of a progression's roots fall in one
  # nine-note collection. That is the right question for 248 catalogue entries of
  # unknown provenance, and the wrong one for a deliberate two-centre vamp, which
  # fails it by construction rather than by accident. Jamal's Pavanne locks to
  # Am7-Bbm7 and scores 0.50; So What locks to Bbm7-Bm7 and scores 0.75, both
  # under the 0.80 threshold — and a modal vamp a semitone apart is exactly the
  # device those two records are famous for.
  #
  # KeyLock already guarantees one tonal centre, so nothing here is protecting
  # against key chaos. Hand-curated, sourced progressions are therefore exempt:
  # they were chosen, and a heuristic for unvetted material should not overrule
  # that.
