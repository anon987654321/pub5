# The rack: named emulations of specific studio hardware.
#
# Each entry below is one real machine, and each is described by what it
# measurably does rather than by how it is supposed to feel. That distinction
# matters. "Warmth" is not a specification; second-harmonic distortion at a
# stated level is. Where a manufacturer or an engineer has said in print what
# a box does, the comment says so and the settings follow it.
#
# The units compose. A signal path of neve_80 into stc8 into gml_matte is three
# entries joined with commas, which is also how the equipment would have been
# patched together.
#
# What is honest about this and what is not: these reproduce the documented
# BEHAVIOUR of each machine -- its harmonic bias, its frequency response, its
# time constants. They do not reproduce its circuit. An emulation built this way
# gets you most of the way to the character and none of the way to the myth,
# which is the correct trade for a pure-Ruby engine with no plugin host.

  # --------------------------------------------------------- Crane Song HEDD
  #
  # The Harmonically Enhanced Digital Device, designed by Dave Hill. Its whole
  # premise is that you choose your distortion rather than avoid it, and it
  # offers three kinds by name.
  #
  # Dave Cooley mastered Donuts, and Crane Song boxes are what he reached for.

  # A note on how these were built, because it decides whether they are worth
  # anything.
  #
  # Each was measured, not guessed. A one-kilohertz tone goes in, and the energy
  # at two and three kilohertz comes out -- the second and third harmonic -- as a
  # level below the tone itself. The figures quoted per unit are those readings.
  # The first attempt at these used aexciter, which produced nothing at all: its
  # `freq` is a SCOPE, so it ignores everything below five kilohertz, and a one
  # kilohertz tone passed through untouched. It measured -93 dB, the noise floor.
  # Had nobody measured, four units would have shipped doing nothing.
  #
  # Note also that asoftclip's `param` runs the opposite way to the intuition:
  # higher is more distortion, not less.

  # TRIODE. Per Crane Song: the even-order harmonics of a single-ended valve
  # stage. Even harmonics are octaves of the note being played, so the ear files
  # them as tone rather than as distortion -- this is what "warm" means when the
  # word is used carefully.
  #
  # Even harmonics require an ASYMMETRIC transfer curve: a shape that treats the
  # top half of the waveform differently from the bottom. A symmetric one, no
  # matter how hard it is driven, produces only odd harmonics. So the signal is
  # pushed off centre, clipped, and pulled back -- which is, near enough, what a
  # valve stage biased to one side does.
  #
  # Measured: 2nd harmonic -37.5 dB, 3rd -60.7 dB. Twenty-three decibels of
  # even-order bias, which is the triode signature.

  end

  # PENTODE. Per Crane Song: mostly third harmonic, and brighter -- they note it
  # sounds like a high-end boost without the drawbacks of one, because it works
  # across the spectrum rather than lifting a band.
  #
  # Odd harmonics are not octaves. The third above a note is a twelfth -- a fifth
  # in the next octave up -- which is why pentode reads as edge and presence
  # where triode reads as body. A symmetric clipper gives odd harmonics and
  # nothing else, so this is the simpler of the two.
  #
  # Measured: 3rd harmonic -35.3 dB, 2nd -91.8 dB. The bias is total.

  # TAPE. Per Crane Song: the compressed sound of driving an analogue recorder
  # into overload. Two things at once, and both are needed -- the soft clipping
  # of the tape itself, and the gentle levelling that comes with it.
  #
  # An arctangent curve rather than a hyperbolic tangent: it leaves the knee
  # earlier and rounds more gradually, which is closer to how tape approaches
  # saturation than to how a transistor does.
  #
  # Measured: 3rd harmonic -56.2 dB. Gentler than the pentode by design; the
  # compressor after it carries as much of the character as the clipping does.

  # The compressor Cooley put Donuts through, and the specific thing he did with
  # it: he timed the release to each track's tempo. His words were that he did it
  # to preserve the disorienting compression pump -- to take the intensity
  # further rather than smooth it away.
  #
  # That is the opposite of the usual advice, which is to set a release that
  # makes compression inaudible. Here the compression is meant to be heard, and
  # tying it to the tempo makes it part of the rhythm instead of a fault in it.
  #
  # Release is one eighth note, so the bus has recovered exactly as the next
  # offbeat lands.

  #
  # A matte top is a WIDE, shallow shelf placed high. It lifts air across the
  # whole top octave without putting an edge on any one frequency. A narrow
  # boost is the slick sound he was avoiding, and the difference between the two
  # is entirely the width.

  #
  # The 8028 and 8078, the desks the seventies are recorded on.
  #
  # Two documented properties. First, transformers: the signal leaves at close
  # to microphone level and is brought back up through output transformers,
  # which are not flat -- the core lifts the low bass slightly and the top rolls
  # away early. Second, the discrete class-A stages depart from linear as they
  # are pushed, and the sum of many small departures across a mix is what people
  # mean by the sound of the desk.
  #
  # Both are small. The temptation to make them large is what makes an emulation
  # sound like an emulation.
  #
  # The nonlinearity is asymmetric, like the triode and for the same reason:
  # transformer cores saturate asymmetrically, and a desk full of them reads as
  # warm rather than as harsh. Measured: 2nd harmonic -54.1 dB, 3rd -75.4 dB.

  # Faster and brighter than neve_80, deliberately. Reach for this one on a
  # drum-led track and the Neve on a sample-led one.
  #
  # Symmetric where the Neve is asymmetric: more third harmonic, less second,
  # which is the edge people describe when they call an API aggressive and a
  # Neve round. Comparable amount of distortion, different flavour of it.
  #
  # Measured: 3rd harmonic -58.8 dB, 2nd below the floor. Set against the Neve's
  # -54 dB of SECOND, the two desks distort about equally and sound nothing
  # alike, which is the whole point of having both.

  #
  # A reel-to-reel, modelled the way CHOW Tape models one: as a machine with
  # parts, not as an effect. Four things happen to audio on tape and all four
  # are here.
  #
  #   HEAD BUMP.  A low resonance around fifty hertz, from the geometry of the
  #               playback head. It is why tape sounds big at the bottom.
  #   HF LOSS.    The top falls away, earlier at slower tape speeds.
  #   WOW.        Slow pitch drift, under a hertz, from an eccentric reel.
  #   FLUTTER.    Fast pitch drift, a few hertz, from the capstan.
  #
  # Wow and flutter are pitch modulation, which is what the vibrato filter does.
  #
  # Its depth turns out to map one-to-one onto percent of pitch deviation --
  # measured by tracking a five-kilohertz tone, where a depth of 0.08 gave
  # exactly plus or minus 0.08 percent. The first version of this unit asked for
  # 0.0022, which is twenty-eight times below what a machine actually does and
  # measured as a dead flat line: no wow at all. A published specification for a
  # studio deck is under 0.05 percent combined; a tired one, or a turntable,
  # reaches 0.1 to 0.3. These sit just above the good machine, which is where a
  # record that has been played a few hundred times sits.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------- Pultec EQP-1A
  #
  # A passive tube equaliser from the 1950s, and the one piece of outboard whose
  # most famous use is a thing its own manual warns against.
  #
  # Its low band has separate boost and attenuate knobs at the same selected
  # frequency, and turning up both should cancel. It does not, because the two
  # circuits are not mirror images: the BOOST is a broad, gentle shelf that
  # starts below the frequency, while the CUT is narrower and starts slightly
  # above it. Use both at 100 Hz and what you get is a lift underneath and a dip
  # at 200 to 400 -- weight added exactly where a kick lives, and mud removed
  # exactly where mud lives.
  #
  # No single control does this, which is why engineers still reach for it
  # seventy years on. It is also precisely the shape a hip-hop low end wants.
  # Dub weight: lower centre, nearly twice the boost, adjacent cut pulled back.
  #
  # The standard setting is a mastering move -- weight without mud, the boost
  # and cut overlapping so the gap between them does the work. Dub wants some
  # of the mud, because the bass is the lead instrument and 80 Hz is where it
  # lives. Measured before adding this: the dub rack with the standard unit came
  # out 6.2 dB DOWN in the low band against its own source, which is the exact
  # opposite of the style.
  def pultec_low_dub
    pultec_low(hz: 80, boost: 7.5, cut: 1.5)
  end

  # A top shelf for the dub rack. It does NOT make the rack net-darker, and the
  # measurements are here so the next person does not repeat the attempt.
  #
  # Gain-matched at -18 LUFS against the dry source, the dub rack measures:
  #
  #   no shelf         low -0.4  mid -0.8  8-13k +1.0
  #   -4 dB @ 7k       low -0.4  mid -0.7  8-13k +1.0
  #   -9 dB @ 6k, LP11 low -0.3  mid -0.7  8-13k +0.6
  #
  # Nine decibels of shelf and an 11 kHz lowpass move the top by four tenths of
  # a decibel. The rack generates top faster than a filter after it can remove
  # it: neve_80 and console_sum are both asymmetric clippers, and the harmonics
  # they add land above the shelf and are regenerated by every stage downstream
  # of wherever the shelf sits.
  #
  # So dub darkness is not a mastering-chain problem. It comes from the source --
  # a rhythm track cut dark, or a lowpass early in the signal path before the
  # saturation rather than after it. Left in at a mild setting because the shelf
  # is still doing something audible on the echo tails, but the comment that
  # claimed this rack was dark was wrong and is now this note instead.

  #
  # Three ways of turning a signal down, which sound nothing alike because of
  # what does the turning.

  # TELETRONIX LA-2A. An optical compressor: the signal drives a small lamp, and
  # a light-sensitive resistor beside it does the gain reduction. The lamp and
  # the cell both take time to respond and neither is linear, so the release is
  # in two stages -- a fast part and a long slow tail -- and it depends on how
  # hard and how long the unit has been working.
  #
  # This is why an LA-2A is described as transparent while compressing heavily:
  # it never grabs, and it lets go slowly enough that you hear the level change
  # as an arrangement decision rather than as an effect. No attack control,
  # because the lamp decides.

  # UREI 1176. A field-effect transistor does the gain reduction, and it does it
  # in microseconds -- the fastest attack here by two orders of magnitude. Fast
  # enough to catch the very front of a snare, which is why it grabs a drum bus
  # and makes it sound like a record.
  #
  # The famous setting is all four ratio buttons pushed in at once, which the
  # unit was never designed to allow: it produces a high ratio with a
  # distorted, lagging knee. That is what the aggressive figures below are.

  # the valves themselves, whose amplification falls as the signal drives them.
  # Twenty valves, a hundred and fifty pounds, and on most of the Beatles
  # catalogue.
  #
  # Variable-mu units are slow and gentle and the ratio rises with how hard they
  # are hit, so they flatter a mix rather than control it. Used here as glue,

  # ------------------------------------------------- Roland RE-201 Space Echo
  #
  # A tape loop running past three playback heads, with a spring reverb bolted
  # on. Two photographs of one sit in Flying Lotus's studio, and it is on a great
  # deal of what he has made.
  #
  # What makes it sound like itself is not the delay times -- any box can do
  # taps. It is that the tape is a physical loop being re-recorded on every pass,
  # so each repeat is a generation further from the original:
  #
  #   DARKER. The tape loses top end every time round. By the fourth repeat
  #   there is little above a few kilohertz, which is why a Space Echo tail
  #   fades into the track instead of cluttering it. A digital delay repeating a
  #   bright sound stays bright and quickly becomes a mess.
  #
  #   UNSTEADY. The transport wows, and the wow accumulates -- the fifth repeat
  #   has been through it five times. The tail drifts in pitch, which is the
  #   sound people mean by "tape delay" and the reason a clean one sounds wrong.
  #
  #   THREE HEADS. Fixed positions on the loop, not free times, so the taps are
  #   in a fixed ratio to each other. Modelled here at roughly 1 : 1.9 : 2.8,
  #   which is where the real heads sit.
  #
  # The darkening is done by putting the lowpass BETWEEN two echo stages rather
  # than after them, so the second stage's repeats are filtered copies of the
  # first stage's -- which is what a feedback loop through tape actually does,
  # and what a single filtered send does not.

  #
  # Dub is not a genre applied to a mix, it is a performance played on the desk.
  # King Tubby and Scientist were engineers reworking rhythm tracks other people
  # had recorded, and the record is what the room's outboard did to them. So
  # these are the boxes that were physically in those rooms, not a mood.

  # SPRING REVERB. The Fisher/Accutronics tank in every console and guitar amp,
  # and nothing like a plate or a hall.
  #
  # Three properties, all of which are usually treated as faults:
  #
  # DISPERSION. A spring is not a delay line -- high frequencies travel through
  # it faster than low ones, so a single hit arrives smeared into a descending
  # chirp. That is the "boing", and cascaded allpass filters are exactly the
  # tool: they delay by frequency without changing amplitude.
  #
  # RESONANCE. A physical spring has strong modes at particular frequencies. A
  # flat decay is a plate; the peaks are what makes a spring identifiable.
  #
  # BANDWIDTH. A tank passes roughly 150 Hz to 4 kHz and nothing outside it,

  # water.
  #
  # Four mechanisms, because each one is a different physical thing:
  #
  # SUBMERSION is a lowpass. Water absorbs high frequencies far faster than air,
  # which is why everything underwater is muffled -- and the cutoff MOVES,
  # because your depth does.
  #
  # SURFACE is chorus. A rippling surface is many slightly different path
  # lengths at once, which is exactly a set of short modulated delays.
  #
  # FLOW is a phaser. Notches sweeping through the spectrum are what a moving
  # boundary between two media sounds like.
  #
  # WOBBLE is vibrato. Sound travels faster in water than air, so a moving
  # medium bends pitch -- small amounts read as wet, large amounts as seasick.

  # ------------------------------------------------------------- mono bass
  #
  # Everything below the crossover collapsed to the centre.
  #
  # This is a cutting-lathe rule that outlived the lathe. Bass energy that
  # differs between the two channels moves the cutting stylus vertically, and
  # enough of it lifts the needle out of the groove -- so records were always cut
  # with a mono bottom. It survives because it turns out to be right for other
  # reasons: a club system's subwoofer is one speaker fed from both channels, so
  # stereo bass partly cancels before anyone hears it, and low frequencies carry
  # no directional information to a listener anyway. The ear locates sound below
  # about 150 Hz by which side is louder, not by anything in the waveform.
  #
  # What it buys is loudness. Two channels of bass in phase are 6 dB louder than
  # two fighting, so the limiter downstream has less to do and the track hits
  # harder at the same measured level.

  # ------------------------------------------------- Console summing bus
  #
  # The stage every other unit here skips. A desk does not only colour each
  # channel on the way in -- the channels then MEET, on a summing bus with its
  # own transformer, its own coupling capacitors, and its own phase behaviour.
  # That bus is why a mix printed through a console does not sound like the same
  # mix summed in software, and it is the last analog thing to touch the audio.
  #
  # Three parts, and only one of them is distortion.
  #
  #   PHASE ROTATION. Two allpass sections, at 90 Hz and 1.8 kHz. An allpass
  #                   changes phase and NOTHING else, which is exactly what a
  #                   chain of transformers and coupling caps does to a signal.
  #                   Measured: 0.00 dB change at 60, 200, 1k, 4k and 12k Hz,
  #                   while phase moves 226, 61, 261, 100 and 28 degrees at those
  #                   same frequencies. That is the "phasy" character, and it is
  #                   real phase rather than an effect pretending to be one.
  #
  #   MOVEMENT.       A slow phaser, 0.1 Hz -- one sweep every ten seconds.
  #                   Not an audible whoosh; a bus that will not sit perfectly
  #                   still, which is the difference between analog and a plugin
  #                   bypassed.
  #
  #   TRANSFORMER.    Gentle asymmetric saturation. Measured 2nd -61.3 dB, 3rd
  #                   -73.8 dB on the same rig that reads neve_80 at 2nd -48.1
  #                   and api_console at 3rd -46.6 -- so roughly 13 dB gentler
  #                   than a channel strip, which is right. A summing bus is not
  #                   a drive stage; if you can hear it working it is wrong.
  #
  # Note the rig: those three figures are comparable to each other because they
  # were taken together. They read 6-12 dB hotter than the older per-unit figures
  # quoted above, which were measured with a different setup -- compare within a
  # set, not across them.
  #
  # TWO NUMBERS ARE NOT FREE CHOICES, and both were found by measurement:
  #
  #   aphaser speed has a hard floor of 0.1 in ffmpeg. Below it the filter is
  #   REFUSED, and a refused filter does not degrade -- it takes the entire chain
  #   with it and the render dies. 0.1 is the slowest legal sweep, which is also
  #   the one wanted here.
  #
  #   aphaser attenuates hard and silently: in_gain 0.5 with the default out_gain
  #   0.72 measured -8.56 dB mean across the band. out_gain 1.9 brings it to
  #   -0.13 dB. With the saturator's own loss on top, the closing makeup is -1.0
  #   dB rather than the -5.0 dB that symmetry with the drive would suggest;
  #   measured net for the whole unit is -0.08 dB. An uncompensated version of
  #   this cost 4 dB and would have read as "the phasy racks are quieter".

  # The same bus, several times over.
  #
  # Engineers stack three or four instances of a virtual console strip at the end
  # of the mix bus rather than running one hard, and report it does something a
  # single instance does not. That is a claim about harmonics, so it was measured
  # rather than believed -- on the rig this file uses everywhere: a 1 kHz tone in,
  # Goertzel out, every row matched to the SAME total distortion so the question
  # is which harmonics carry it rather than how much there is.
  #
  #   matched to 1.5% THD      drive      2nd       3rd     even over odd
  #   1 stage                  14.4 dB    -36.6    -51.9        15.3 dB
  #   2 stages                  9.4 dB    -36.5    -60.8        24.3 dB
  #   3 stages                  7.7 dB    -36.5    -74.7        38.2 dB
  #
  # The second harmonic does not move -- the THD match holds it there, since it
  # is most of the THD. What changes is the THIRD, which falls 23 dB across the
  # three rows. Same amount of distortion, progressively less of it odd.
  #
  # That is the whole effect, and it is worth stating in musical terms because
  # the numbers are otherwise numbers: the second harmonic is an octave, so
  # the ear files it as tone. The third is a twelfth -- a fifth, in the next
  # octave up -- and it is what "harsh" means on a mix bus. Driving one stage
  # hard buys both. Driving three gently buys the octave and leaves the fifth
  # behind. Nobody stacking these is imagining it.
  #
  # Why it happens: each stage's asymmetric curve is nearly linear at low drive,
  # where a tanh's expansion is dominated by its quadratic term -- the even one.
  # The cubic term, which makes the third harmonic, grows far faster with drive
  # than the quadratic does, so splitting the same total distortion across more
  # stages at lower drive each keeps the quadratic and starves the cubic.
  #
  # The drives below come from that measurement: they are what put each stack at
  # roughly the distortion one console_sum produces alone, so raising the count
  # changes the CHARACTER without changing the amount. Stacking without dropping
  # the per-stage drive is a different and much louder decision, and it is not
  # this one.
  STACK_DRIVE = { 1 => 5.0, 2 => 3.2, 3 => 2.5, 4 => 2.1 }.freeze

  # And the makeup each depth needs to come out where it went in.
  #
  # This is not arithmetic and it could not be guessed. asoftclip's oversample=4
  # is NOT gain-compensated in ffmpeg 8.1.1: measured against the identical
  # clipper without it, the oversampled one reads -4.2 dB where the plain one
  # reads +1.5 dB. Nearly six decibels, per stage, invisible in the parameters.
  #
  # A first attempt at this stack carried console_sum's own -1.0 dB makeup and
  # measured -0.2, -3.0, -6.6 and -10.3 dB at one through four instances. That is
  # the failure console_sum's header already warns about, in the same file, one
  # method up: "an uncompensated version of this cost 4 dB and would have read as
  # 'the phasy racks are quieter'". A stack that gets quieter as you add
  # instances would be compared against a bypass and lose every time -- and the
  # comparison would be measuring the makeup, not the stacking.
  #
  # So each depth was measured against the same 87-second render and the loss
  # written down. Net after compensation is 0.0 dB at every depth, which is what
  # makes A/B-ing the count a test of the sound rather than of the level.

  # ------------------------------------------- Bode frequency shifter
  #
  # Not a pitch shifter, and the difference is the whole unit.
  #
  # A pitch shift multiplies every partial by the same ratio, so a harmonic
  # series stays a harmonic series and the sound keeps its identity an octave up.
  # A FREQUENCY shift adds the same number of hertz to every partial, so 100,
  # 200, 300 becomes 200, 300, 400 -- ratios of 1:1.5:2 instead of 1:2:3. The
  # result is inharmonic by construction, which is why the Bode shifter is a
  # klangumwandler and not a transposer, and why small shifts read as metallic
  # rather than as a wrong note.
  #
  # Measured: a 1 kHz tone shifted +100 arrives at 1100 Hz, -100 at 900, +300 at
  # 1300. Exactly the stated hertz, which is the one thing worth checking about a
  # filter nothing in this engine had ever called.
  #
  # Small values are the musical ones. Past about 50 Hz the source stops being
  # recognisable, which is the same boundary sample_morph draws for FM depth and
  # for the same reason: the ear tracks a pitch until the partials stop agreeing

  # Phase, and nothing else. Measured against a 1 kHz tone the spectrum is
  # unchanged to the noise floor -- identical to bypass at every bin.
  #
  # So on its own it is inaudible, and that is not a fault: it is the same
  # property that makes console_sum's allpass stages worth having. It becomes
  # audible the moment it meets a copy of itself, which is how it is used. Summed
  # against the dry signal at 1 kHz:
  #
  #   shift 0.1   -6.5 dB    near cancellation
  #   shift 0.25  -0.8 dB
  #   shift 0.5   +3.7 dB
  #   shift 1.0   +6.0 dB    fully in phase, so the sum doubles
  #
  # Which makes it a comb filter whose notches do not move with frequency the way
  # a delay's do -- a delay's comb is periodic in hertz, this one is flat across
  # the spectrum. That is the difference between a flanger and a phase rotator,
  # and it is why this one thickens without the sweep being obvious.

    # SP-1200 and vinyl emulation already in the path, and the samples came back
    # sounding like guitars through an overdriven amp. Without it: 0.2 percent,
