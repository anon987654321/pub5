# Every rendered file gets a recipe beside it, so any render can be made again.
#
# Before this, none could. RENDER_SEED already pinned the whole engine — patch
# selection, all 31 anoisesrc sites, render_rand, the 26 seeds built out of
# Ruby's per-process String#hash — and that work was thorough. What was missing
# is that nothing ever wrote the seed down. Unset, the engine draws from
# Process.pid and ffmpeg's own RNG, so a render was gone the moment it finished:
# su_tunnel_choir.wav (2026-08-11 03:35) cannot be reproduced, and neither can
# any of the 616 audio files beside it.
#
# So the seed is always chosen now, never left to chance-without-a-record. If
# RENDER_SEED is set, that is used and honoured exactly as before. If it is not,
# one is drawn at random — the render still differs from the last, which is the
# behaviour the engine documents and wants — and then written into a .dilla file
# next to every audio file the run produced.
#
# The consequence worth stating plainly: an unpinned render is now produced
# through the pinned code paths, because ENV["RENDER_SEED"] is set before any of
# them run. render_pinned? is true, so noise comes from seed_for(tag) rather than
# ffmpeg's seed=-1, and render_rand is seeded rather than rand. Two unpinned
# renders still differ from each other exactly as they did. What changes is that
# each one is now a draw that can be replayed instead of one that cannot.
#
# DILLA_NO_PROVENANCE=1 restores the old behaviour completely, seed and all.

    # The knobs that change what comes out, derived from the engine rather than

    # The first version was a hand-kept allow-list of eleven names. v4 was
    # rendered with fifteen knobs set and the manifest recorded six of them --
    # PAD_VOL, GROOVE_FEEL, KICK_GAIN, ANALOG_CHAIN, SONITEX and RAP_VOCAL all
    # missing -- so the file said "reproduce with" above a command that would
    # not. A provenance record that is silently partial is worse than none,
    # because it is believed.
    #
    # So the set is whatever the engine actually reads: every ENV["X"] and
    # ENV.fetch("X" in dilla.rb and lib/. That cannot go stale against a new
    # knob, which a list maintained beside the code always does.
    #
    # It went stale anyway, against a moved knob rather than a new one. The glob
    # was `lib/*.rb`, one level deep, which was every file lib/ had until the
    # engine was split into lib/engine/ (c94fe8b00). After it, the scan found 126
    # of 610 knobs: PROGRESSION, SONITEX, RAP_VOCAL, ANALOG_CHAIN, PAD_VOL and
    # KICK_GAIN were all missing again — five of the six names in the paragraph
    # above, recorded there as the reason the hand-kept list was abandoned. The
    # manifests written between the split and this fix say "reproduce with" over
    # a command that will not.

    # own opinion about which files the engine is, and so did four other places.
