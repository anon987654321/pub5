# What "the engine" is, in one place.
#
# Five different pieces of code have needed to answer "which files is the engine
# made of", and every one of them answered it separately:
#
#   dilla.rb              ENGINE_SOURCES = dilla.rb + lib/engine/*.rb
#   cli_commands.rb       that, plus Dir[lib/*.rb], spelled out twice
#   provenance.rb         dilla.rb + Dir[lib/**/*.rb]
#   analysis.rb           ENGINE_SOURCES (so lib/*.rb was never parse-checked)
#   stream.rb             engine_mtime over ENGINE_SOURCES
#
# Three different corpora, and the disagreements were not academic. The parse
# check reported "ruby syntax: ok" over a set that excluded all thirty lib/*.rb
# files, which is the check MASTER's autofix has already broken this engine
# past. Provenance's glob went one level deeper than the others and, when the
# engine split into lib/engine/, dropped 484 of 610 knobs out of every manifest
# without failing anything.
#
# So this file is the definition and nothing else re-derives it. It deliberately
# has no dependencies -- not on dilla.rb, not on ROOT, not on a gem -- so that
# provenance and the test suite can require it directly without booting the
# engine.
module DillaSources
  # The engine's own top-level program, split by concern. Required in the order
  # they were written in, which is load-bearing: constants in these files are
  # computed at load time from ones above them, and reordering silently changes
  # their values. This list moved here from dilla.rb; dilla.rb still drives the
  # requires, it no longer owns the list.
  # audio_graph leads because it depends on nothing: it is a graph builder that
  # returns a string, so any part below it may hand it channels. %w[] takes no
  # comments, which is why this one is here and not beside the entry.
