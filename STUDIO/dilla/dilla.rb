# lib/music_gems must load — and bootstrap! must run — before anything else
# requires a gem this Gemfile.lock pins (json 2.19.1, yaml/psych, ostruct):
# whichever code activates a gem name first wins for the whole process, and an
# unconstrained `require "json"`/`require "yaml"` below would activate
# whatever version ships as a Ruby default gem (e.g. json 2.20.0 on 3.4.9),
# so bootstrap!'s own `require "bundler/setup"` then conflicts and silently
# disables coltrane/midilib/wavefile/head_music for the rest of the process
# (bootstrap! rescues LoadError). Real invocations run plain `ruby dilla.rb`,
# not `bundle exec`, so this ordering is the only thing that pins it correctly.
# Before anything reads a file. The engine's own sources carry UTF-8 — em dashes
# and Norwegian vowels in comments and track names — and 37 File.read/readlines
# sites across lib/ ask for no encoding, so they inherit the locale's. Under a C
# or POSIX locale that is US-ASCII, and the first thing to read a source file
# raises: `env -i ruby dilla.rb help` died at lib/knobs.rb:228 building the knob
# table, before printing a word of help.
#
# It never bit interactively because a login shell exports a UTF-8 LANG. It bites
# anything that does not: cron, a minimal deploy shell, an agent's non-login
# invocation. One assignment here rather than an encoding: argument on all 37,
# which is also how RAILS/gates/runner.rb solved the identical problem — see
# OPENBSD/lib/utf8.rb and the comment above its require.

# force_env! overwrites unconditionally, so a style table always beat the
# command line: `SONITEX=heavy ruby dilla.rb ...` rendered donuts_warm,
# because DILLA_STYLE_DEFAULTS force both SONITEX and SONITEX_PRESET and ran
# after the caller's value was already in place. That is true of every knob
# those tables name, not just this one -- the documented environment
# variables were advisory at best.
#
# Captured before any require can mutate ENV. force_env! consults it and
# records the skip in config_provenance, so `print_config_provenance` shows
# which values the caller pinned and which a style chose.
#
# The stream re-execs itself when this file's mtime changes, and exec inherits
# the whole environment — including everything apply_best_defaults! and the
# style tables had already written into it. So after one restart the child's
# "user pins" contained TRACK/PROGRESSION=pedal_e_descent, values no user ever
# typed, and force_env! then refused to let any track's own progression
# overwrite them. Asking for slum_village_players_documented rendered its name
# and its 91 BPM over pedal_e_descent's chords, and no amount of restarting fixed
# it because each restart re-laundered the same defaults.
#
# The restart therefore declares the real pin set, and only those keys count as
# pinned in the child. Absent the declaration (a normal command line) every
# environment variable present at load is a pin, as before.

# Album master. The chain per track, in this order:
#
#   1. side-gain correction     The fix. Five tracks measured a SIDE channel
#                               louder than their MID, which is not a wide mix
#                               but out-of-phase content, and it collapses 6-8 dB
#                               summed to mono. Their source samples are healthy
#                               (-5 to -7.5 dB side/mid), so the width comes from
#                               the render chain. Applied only where measurement
#                               says it is needed.
#   2. true-peak limit          Recovers level without compressing. Pure gain left
#                               the album at -15.4 LUFS because one track peaked
#                               at +0.1 dBFS.
#   3. dither to 16-bit         Triangular with high-pass noise shaping, so
#                               truncation noise is not quantised into the
#                               program material.
#
# What it cannot fix: a source that is a lossy mp3 makes the deliverable a
# second-generation encode. `rerender` to .wav first is the answer to that.
#
# -19.0 is the house target for dilla material, NOT the -14 streaming figure.
# MASTER_LUFS_BY_STYLE records why: pulled down ~3 dB across the board after
# direct feedback that it read as fatiguing even when true peak was safe. -14 is
