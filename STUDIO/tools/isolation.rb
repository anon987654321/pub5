# Which tests only pass because of the company they keep, and which only fail.
#
# dilla's files deliberately share one process — the engine takes half a second
# to load and there is nothing for six files to collide over — so every test in
# that suite can see what the ones before it left behind. Three defects this
# session had exactly that shape and each was invisible from a normal run:
#
#   provenance recorded DILLA_QUIET, DILLA_ASSET_CHECK and DILLA_KNOB_CHECK as
#   operator pins. The suite sets all three to keep itself quiet, Open3 merges
#   the parent environment into the child, and the manifest wrote the harness's
#   plumbing down as the operator's choices. Passed alone, failed in the suite.
#
#   the frozen test compares File.mtime on project/session.json, which other
#   probes in the same suite write. Fails intermittently in the suite, never
#   alone.
#
#   a stale renderer count passed alone and failed once the file it counted grew.
#
# All three were found by running one test on its own after a hunch. This does
# it for all of them, which is the difference between noticing and checking.
#
# The two directions are not the same defect and are reported separately:
#
#   suite-only failure   the test is right and something before it interferes
#   isolation-only failure   the test needs setup a neighbour happens to do,
#                            so it is asserting less than it claims
