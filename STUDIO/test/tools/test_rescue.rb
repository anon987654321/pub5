# "Make any bad photo look good", with "although I realize that's a stretch"
# attached. The stretch is not uniform, and that is the whole design:
# PHOTOGRAPHY.md splits a photograph into four layers that fail independently,
# and exactly one of them is a grade's to fix.
#
# So the tests that matter most here are the ones asserting what it REFUSES. A
# rescue tool that quietly tries everything and reports success is lying about
# three layers out of four, and the lie is expensive: it costs a reshoot that
# would have worked.
