  # A hung probe (coltrane-gem hang — see README) used to pin a
  # dilla_test_probe process near 100% CPU forever with no output and no
  # test failure — a silently-stuck test run. Bounded here: on timeout
  # the child (and its process group, in case it spawned ffmpeg/fluidsynth)
  # gets killed and the test fails loudly instead of hanging the suite.
  # Every probe loads the whole engine in a fresh subprocess, and `rake test`
  # runs these alongside 880-odd other tests, so a fixed 30s budget was tight
  # enough to fire spuriously under load — one run errored here with
  # Timeout::Error while the next passed. 90s still bounds a genuine hang (the
  # coltrane-gem case below) without failing on a busy machine; DILLA_PROBE_TIMEOUT
  # overrides it for slower hosts.
  PROBE_TIMEOUT = Integer(ENV.fetch("DILLA_PROBE_TIMEOUT", "90"))

  # There is no state restoration here, deliberately. Its absence is the fix,
  # not a regression, and the reason is worth keeping because a restoring version
  # looks strictly safer than having nothing.
  #
  # Loading the engine writes dilla's session and learnings JSON, and those are
  # tracked files in a tree this suite does not own. Two separate hooks restored
  # them: Studio.restore_engine_state! in test/helper.rb, and a Minitest.after_run
  # block here. Two hooks, one file, and -- this is the part that made it a bug --
  # SNAPSHOTS TAKEN AT DIFFERENT MOMENTS.
  #
  #   test/helper.rb        binreads project/**/*.json when the helper loads.
  #   test/dilla/helper.rb  then requires the engine, WHICH WRITES session.json.
  #   this file             binread the same paths after that, at its own load.
  #
  # So the helper held the pristine bytes and this file held the already-dirtied
  # ones. Both fired at exit, and whichever ran last decided the outcome -- with
  # this one last, the "restore" put the engine's load-time write back and undid
  # the helper's work. `M STUDIO/dilla/project/session.json` after a clean suite
  # run is that, and it is exactly the tree-dirtying the block was added to stop.
  #
  # The second cost was a flaky test. test_dilla_frozen_... asserted the file's
  # MTIME, and a restore that writes byte-identical content still moves an mtime,
  # so a hook doing nothing meaningful could fail a test about the engine. That
  # test now asserts content, which is what its own contract is about.
  #
  # One hook, snapshotting earliest, covering a superset of these three paths:
  # test/helper.rb's glob is dilla/project/**/*.json. Nothing is lost by deleting
  # this, and the earlier snapshot is the correct one.

  # `env:` is injected before the engine loads, which is the only point at which
  # it can matter: the engine reads most switches into constants and memoizes
  # pools at load, so setting ENV inside `script` is too late and silently reads
  # back the default. A test that flips a switch between two calls in one process
  # gets the first pool twice.
  # Retried once on timeout, because a timeout is not a hang.
  #
  # The bound exists for a real failure — the coltrane-gem hang pinned a probe
  # near 100% CPU forever with no output and no test failure. But every probe
  # loads the whole engine in a fresh subprocess and some of them render audio,
  # and the budget has now been too tight twice for the same reason: 30s fired
  # spuriously, was raised to 90s, and 90s fires spuriously on a machine with
  # other sessions on it. The two-bar smoke render takes 21s alone and exceeds
  # 90s under contention.
  #
  # Raising it again trades away the thing it is for. A hang does not finish on
  # the second attempt either, so one retry separates the two: a genuine hang
  # costs twice the budget and still fails, and a load spike costs one wasted
  # probe and passes. This is the same conclusion RAILS/gates dns_zones reached
  # about a dropped UDP packet — a timeout is not an absent record.

    #
    # Why: stream_iterate_evolve_harmony! seeds its RNG from
    # Time.now.to_i + Process.pid + @stream_iterate_count, then only assigns
    # ENV["TRACK"]/["VOICING"] inside `elsif rng.rand < 0.55` (or a 0.35 branch).
    # So roughly half of all runs legitimately set nothing, and asserting that
    # they always do was asserting the dice.
    #
    # What is actually contractual: both calls return a note array, and any state
    # a note *claims* must be present in ENV. That is the invariant worth
    # guarding — a note saying "voicing=x" while ENV carries nothing would be a
    # real bug, and this still catches it.
    #
    # To restore the strong assertions, the engine needs a seedable RNG (e.g. a
    # DILLA_SEED env read in place of the Time/pid seed). That belongs in
