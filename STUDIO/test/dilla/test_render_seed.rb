# RENDER_SEED is the engine's one reproducibility claim, and it has been wrong
# twice: once because ffmpeg's anoisesrc drew a fresh seed per process at 31
# call sites, and once because twenty-six sites built seeds out of String#hash,
# which Ruby randomises per process. Both times the pin read as real and was
# not, and the only way to tell was to render twice and diff samples.
#
# These pin the arithmetic instead. Every value below is reproduced from the
# implementation's own definition, not copied from a run.
