# Parity for the second renderer, and the one the spine exists to rescue.
#
# render_industrial builds its bed by hand at lib/engine/render_industrial.rb
# 155-171: four sources, one of them conditional on a file existing, summed with
# positional weights. This reproduces that bed through AudioGraph and compares
# the emitted graph as text, in both the with-texture and without-texture cases,
# because the conditional channel is where a hand-built weights list is easiest
# to get wrong.
#
# It reproduces the CURRENT graph, wrong parts included. render_industrial omits
# normalize=0 where render_dilla sets it, and measured against a 440Hz reference
# that is a 4.1 dB difference (-21.07 vs -16.94 RMS) into a chain of
# level-dependent stages. Proving parity first is what makes changing it later a
# decision with a measurement behind it rather than a side effect of a refactor.
