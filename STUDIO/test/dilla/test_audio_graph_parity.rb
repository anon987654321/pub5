# The spine is only worth moving a genre onto if it emits what the working
# renderer already emits. This reconstructs render_dilla's stem mixdown
# (lib/engine/render_dilla.rb around 637-692) as literal strings, builds the same
# thing through AudioGraph, and compares the two as text.
#
# The literals here are copied from that renderer, weights included. If someone
# retunes 0.82 or 0.68 there and not here, this test fails and says the two have
# diverged -- which is the point. It is a parity pin, not a second opinion about
# what the mix should be.
