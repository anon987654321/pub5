# A device no renderer can call is a device that cannot change a render.

# pad voices, 209 of 250 progressions, the chopped sample loops and a pad whose
# effect chain had never once opened all shipped complete, correct and
# unreachable. Six new devices arrived the same way -- built, tested, and
# callable only from the command line.
#
# So reach is a ratchet. A module here has to be named by something that is not
# itself, not its own CLI command, and not a test: a renderer, a bus builder, a
# scheduler -- code a render actually runs.
#
# The path is the module's OWN file, excluded from the search so a module is
# never counted as calling itself. Keeping it right matters more than it looks:
# after the merge into devices.rb these still named copy_machine.rb,
