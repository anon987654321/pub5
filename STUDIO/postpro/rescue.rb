# What is wrong with this photograph, and which half of it a grade can fix.
#
# The ask was "make any bad photo look good", with "although I realize that's a
# stretch" attached — and the stretch is the interesting part, because it is not
# uniformly a stretch. STUDIO/PHOTOGRAPHY.md splits a photograph into four
# layers that fail independently:
#
#   geometry     perspective distortion from shooting too close. A projection,
#                not a rendering. NOT FIXABLE, at any effort.
#   light        the pattern the key made. Gradeable as tonality; a grade
#                cannot move a shadow to the other side of a nose. PARTLY.
#   expression   the moment. NOT FIXABLE.
#   optical      plastic skin, digital cleanliness, clipped highlights, colour
#                cast. THIS IS WHAT A GRADE IS FOR.
#
# So a rescue tool that quietly tries everything and reports success is lying
# about three of the four. This one names what it fixed, and — the part that
# makes it worth having — names what it cannot, so the answer can be "reshoot at
# three metres" rather than a grade that was never going to work.

    # and all three are fixed the same way.

    # recover what was never recorded, and saying so is the whole point.

    # Raised from 12.0, which diagnosed a cast on six of nine ordinary
    # photographs of one person. Skin is not neutral: it is red over green over
    # blue by a wide margin in every light, so any frame filled by a face clears
    # a 12-point spread on its subject alone. The threshold was measuring "is
    # there a person in this picture".
    #
    # 12 was not arbitrary either — it is a reasonable number for a frame of
    # mixed content. The mistake was applying a whole-frame threshold to
    # portraits, which is what this tool is mostly pointed at.

    # above them. 34 keeps the two that are genuinely cast (one shot under
    # tungsten, one with a filter already baked in) and drops the four that were
    # only faces.
