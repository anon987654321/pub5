  #   exposure    spectral_temp, halation      (halation is light reflecting off
  #                                            the film base back through the
  #                                            emulsion, so it precedes the curve)
  #   emulsion    emulsion_defocus             (dye layers sit at different depths)
  #   development film_curve, stock_matrix, dir_coupler, adjacency_effects
  #   negative    orange_mask
  #   print       print_film
  #   tone        skin_protect, shadow_lift, highlight_roll, micro_contrast
  #   grain       last, because it is a property of the emulsion the print sees
  #   gate        film_curl_vignette
  #
  # Safe as a default only because the source-aware scaling above exists: on a
  # photograph that already has texture and contrast, the defocus goes to zero
  # and the curve backs off, so eighteen steps do not mean eighteen
  # subtractions. Against a generated image it runs at full strength, which is
  # what a generated image needs.
  # Two effects are deliberately NOT in this chain, having been measured in it
  # and taken out. chromatic_aberration cost 0.0265 of texture and
  # film_curl_vignette 0.0428 — together two thirds of the picture's
  # micro-detail, and a vignette that dropped mean brightness by 53.8 levels.
  # Both are legitimate and both remain available to the presets that want
  # them; neither belongs in the one grade that runs when nobody chose.
  #
  # They are scaled now rather than merely excluded. When this was written the
  # taper reached only the defocus and the curve, and the paragraph above was
  # the only thing standing between a photograph and the damage — a note is not
  # a mechanism. head[:fringe] and head[:vignette] taper on texture, so the two
  # presets that want each still get them at a strength the source can afford.
  # Keeping them out of the default is a separate decision and it stands.
  #
  # NOTHING IN THIS CHAIN SOFTENS THE PICTURE.
  #
  # optical_blur, emulsion_defocus and vintage_lens are all out — the last one
  # took `lens:` with it, since it was that key's only reader and an unread key
  # is a --vocab-check failure. They are lens simulation, and lens simulation on
  # a frame that was already taken through a lens is invention, not emulation.
  # Softness is also the one artefact that cannot be undone downstream, which
  # makes it the wrong thing for a default to add on the operator's behalf.
  #
  # What is left is tone, colour and emulsion: the H&D curve, dye crosstalk,
  # coupler inhibition, adjacency, the negative's mask, the print stock, and
  # grain. Halation stays and is not a blur — it adds light that bounced off the
  # film base back through the emulsion, which is why it glows rather than
  # smears, and it measured at -0.0001 texture.
  #
  # This is the difference between a film emulation and a lo-fi filter. No lomo,
  # no scan lines, no vignette, no defocus.

# Clamp to 0..255 and quantise to 8-bit — EXCEPT inside a preset chain.
#
# Every effect ends by calling this, so a sixteen-step chain used to round to
# 8-bit sixteen times and, worse, clamp sixteen times. The rounding costs
# precision; the clamping costs information that cannot be recovered. A step
# that pushes a highlight to 260 has it cut to 255 permanently, and the next
# step — the shoulder that exists precisely to roll that highlight back down —
# receives a flat white plateau where the negative had detail.
#
# That is the opposite of what the thing being emulated does. The whole point of
# a colour negative is latitude: it holds values far above and below what a
# print shows, and the curve decides afterwards what becomes white. Clamping at
# every stage models a sensor, not a film.
#
# So inside a chain the values stay float and unbounded, and preset() clamps
# once at the end. Outside a chain — a bare effect call, a recipe step, a caller
# that hands the result straight to write_to_file — behaviour is unchanged,
# because those have no later step to hand headroom to.

# Recovered from the first generation of this file, and rebuilt rather than
# restored. The original drew two to eight filled circles at random coordinates,
# which is not what a light leak is: light enters at a cassette seam, a failing
# door hinge or the film gate, so it arrives from a FRAME EDGE and falls off
# inward. A disc in the middle of the picture has no physical account at all.
#
# Built as a distance ramp from one edge, raised to a power for the falloff and
# added rather than blended, because fogging is additive exposure — the emulsion
# receives light it should not have, and the shadows go first. That is also why
# it lifts blacks far more visibly than highlights without any explicit masking.
#
# The warm colour is not a style choice. A leak is usually red-to-orange because
# the film base and the cassette felt pass long wavelengths most readily, and
# because the red-sensitive layer sits deepest and takes the most stray light.

# How much of the grade this picture actually needs.
#
# Every preset here was tuned against generated images, and against those it is
# purely additive: a render arrives with no micro-texture and no toe, so
# optical_blur costs nothing (there is no detail to lose), film_curve has the
# whole tonal range to play with, and grain is the point of the exercise.
#
# Point the same chain at a photograph and each of those becomes a subtraction.
# Measured on a phone photograph through `portrait`: film_curve took 14.7 levels
# of contrast out and added 11.4 of brightness, shadow_lift another 4.3, and
# optical_blur removed roughly four times more texture than grain put back. The
# result is milky, flat and pink, and it is worse than the input by every number
# uncanny.rb reports.
#
# So the subtractive steps are scaled by what the source arrived with. A flat
# render measures near zero on both axes and gets the full grade unchanged —
# which the golden-grade suite pins, since `portrait` must still put texture
# into a flat field. A photograph measures high and gets the smoothing and the
# curve backed off, while grain, the stock's colour and the toe still apply.
#
# On by default and not reachable by a flag, deliberately: a grade that damages
# real photographs unless you know to disable it is a grade that damages real
# photographs.
#
# The knees are calibrated, not guessed. Below TEXTURE_FLOOR is rescue.rb's
# definition of "no micro-detail" — phone noise reduction, a beauty filter, or
# a diffusion model. TEXTURE_NATIVE is the low end of the nine phone photographs
# measured here, which ran 0.015 to 0.092. The tonal pair is the same idea on
# the contrast axis: those photographs ran 0.15 to 0.28.

# The curve never scales to nothing: the stock has a look, and a photograph
# that needs none of the repair should still come out graded rather than
# untouched. Defocus does scale to nothing, because simulated lens softness is
# not a look anyone asked for on a frame that is already sharp — it is only
# ever there to give grain something to sit on.
#
# 0.70, raised from 0.25, because 0.25 was protecting the picture from the
# grade rather than from damage. On a set of ordinary phone photographs the
# taper measured them as already-good and cut the curve to a quarter, which
# moved the mean about four levels and was invisible — the operator's report
# was that postpro had never run, and the files had in fact been graded twice.
#
# The confusion was mine: I conflated subtractive with damaging. A film curve
# compresses contrast, and that compression IS the look — the shoulder, the toe,
# the way a highlight rolls instead of clipping. Measured on a real photograph,
# the difference between 0.25 and 0.70 is eight points of texture (99% kept
# against 91%, both comfortably inside the golden suite's 75% floor) and a
# tonal shift from -0.05 to -0.07. Cheap, and the difference between a grade
# you can see and one you cannot.
#
# What actually damaged photographs was never the curve. It was dir_coupler
# rebuilding every band from a blurred copy, and defocus whose sigma floors
# ignored any request to soften less. Both are fixed at the mechanism. The
# taper should hold back the effects that destroy information and let the ones
# that shape tone do their work.

# Where a recipe's single number actually belongs.
#
# recipe() called send(method, image, intensity) on all 81 allowed effects, on
# the assumption that every one of them takes an intensity second. Nineteen do
# not. Their second parameter is a film stock, an RGB triplet, a Kelvin value, a
# pixel radius, an ISO speed, an f-number, a distortion coefficient, a 0-255
# threshold or a lens name -- and two of them take keyword arguments only, so
# {"tonemap": 0.6} raised ArgumentError, the per-file rescue swallowed it,
# and the whole image was logged as "Failed" for one line of a recipe.
#
# The rest were worse than the crash, because they worked. {"film_curve": 0.7}
# looked up STOCKS[0.7]; {"color_temp": 0.5} asked for half a Kelvin;
# {"split_toning": 0.4} handed a Float to something that indexes it as a colour;
# {"lens_distortion": 0.5} bent the frame the opposite way from every preset,
# which all pass a negative coefficient. A recipe is the one route in this file
# where the user writes the numbers themselves, and it was the route that
# ignored them.
#
# Each adapter maps intensity onto the parameter that effect is about,
# and reads the rest from the recipe entry when it is written as an object:
# {"grain": {"intensity": 0.5, "stock": "tri_x", "iso": 1600}}.
