# Four numbers that say whether a picture looks rendered.
#
# PHOTOGRAPHY.md §4 states the failure and STUDIO/AMBITION.md §F 96-98 asks for
# this: generated skin is too clean and its specular response uniform, because
# diffusion models learn from retouched photography and carry no account of
# subsurface scattering. Everything written about fixing that — the grain, the
# halation, the H&D shoulder, the whole of §G — is an assertion until something
# measures it.
#
# Deliberately whole-image and deliberately without face detection. A metric
# that needs a face model is a metric that fails on half the inputs and brings a
# second dependency to disagree with; these four work on any image and move in
# the right direction for the right reasons. They are proxies and are named as
# proxies.
#
# The number to watch is not any single score. It is the DELTA across postpro:
# if the grade is doing what §4 claims, texture rises and clipping falls, and if
# it is not, that shows up here rather than in an argument.
