# Decisions

Deploy and VPS policy. Agent/runtime policy lives in `MASTER/DECISIONS.md`.

## No Fourth Public App Until brgen Boundaries Hold (2026-07)

**Status:** accepted  
**Context:** brgen already hosts many verticals (social, marketplace, dating, playlist, takeaway, TV, maps, live, messenger) in one deployable Rails app. Historical restarts (aight → ai3 → pub2 → pub3 → pub4) repeatedly expanded surface before isolation and shared contracts were boring.

**Decision:** Do not add a **fourth public Rails app** (beyond brgen, amber, bsdports) until:

1. High-churn brgen verticals (marketplace, dating, takeaway at minimum) are **namespaced engines** with their own migrations and test boundaries (still one `rc.d` service is fine).
2. Cross-cutting money (**øre/cents**) and **trust/identity** primitives live in `RAILS/shared` with unit tests consumed by more than one app.
3. CI runs **layout_suite** (design craft) plus **/up smoke** for all three inventory apps on every relevant change.

**Consequences:** New product energy goes into Bergen density (seed, guest demo path Live → listing → message) and engine extraction, not `hjerterom`/`blognet`-class launches. Horizon ideas stay in `RAILS/apps.horizon.yml` with `agent: ignore` until the three gates above are green.

## Repo Layout (2026-07)

- `RAILS/` — Rails apps + shared engine (was `DEPLOY/rails`)
- `OPENBSD/` — VPS config backup (`etc/`, `usr/`, `var/`) plus deploy tooling (`bin/`, `lib/`, `sh/`, gates)
- The `DEPLOY → OPERATOR → OPENBSD` renames completed 2026-07-14; legacy path strings still resolve via `MASTER/lib/pub4/paths.rb`

## OpenBSD First

OPENBSD targets vm23. macOS local checks are useful, but OpenBSD behavior wins for package names, service management, relayd, pf, NSD, and Ruby command names.

## The Nameserver Owns The Zones, Not The Repo (2026-08-02)

We run our own authoritative nsd with a lot of domains — 61 zones in
`/var/nsd/zones/master`, none of them in git, and that is deliberate. The
signed artifacts (`*.zone.signed`, `K*.key`, `K*.ds`) are regenerated on every
re-sign, so mirroring zone data would put a churning copy of the DNS into every
diff while the nameserver stays the real source of truth.

`OPENBSD/sync.rb` used to glob all four zone patterns. It had never actually
been run, which is the only reason the repo is clean of them; the globs are now
removed so the first person to run it does not import 61 zones by accident.
`nsd.conf` is still mirrored — that is server configuration, not zone data.

An audit that reports "61 zone files missing from the repo" is describing this
decision, not a gap. Do not close it.

## `OPENBSD/lib/` Owns The Gate Kernel, On Purpose (2026-08-13)

**Status:** accepted

**Context:** `Deploy::GateResult` lives in `OPENBSD/lib/` and RAILS requires it at
53 sites — with `deploy_inventory` (16) and `utf8` (5), 74 requires across the
tree boundary. RAILS's whole 59-file gate framework is built on a type owned by
the deploy tree, and the directory names say the opposite. `data/debt.yml`
(`gate_result_is_a_shared_kernel_filed_under_deploy`) measured that in 2026-08
and named the two ways out: extract a repo-level shared kernel, or write this
entry. It stayed unwritten, and 2026-08-13 added `gate_ledger.rb` beside
`gate_result.rb` — so the choice was being made by accretion instead.

**Decision:** the deploy tree owns the gate kernel. `OPENBSD/lib/` holds the
types every gate returns and the state every gate reads; RAILS, MASTER and
STUDIO consume them by `require_relative` across the boundary and add nothing to
them.

**Why not a repo-level `lib/`:** a fourth top-level tree whose only content is
three files, and the dependency it would remove is one RAILS already has and
does not suffer from. The real asymmetry is the other way and worth keeping:
**MASTER requires nothing from either tree** — it reads their data (`apps.yml`,
`debt.yml`) and shells out to their scripts, but no `require_relative` crosses
into it. That independence is what a shared kernel would quietly erode, because
a kernel is exactly the thing everything ends up requiring.

**Consequences:**

- A gate anywhere returns `Deploy::GateResult`. Adding an outcome to it is a
  deploy-tree change with four consumers (`RAILS/gates/runner.rb`,
  `OPENBSD/bin/check-*`, `STUDIO/gate.rb`, `OPENBSD/lib/gate_environment.rb`),
  not a local one.
- MASTER reaches STUDIO's gate by subprocess (`rake studio` shells out) rather
  than by require, specifically so `MASTER/Gemfile` and `MASTER/lib` stay clear
  of `OPENBSD/lib`. That is the rule this entry exists to keep visible.
- If a fourth tree ever needs the kernel and cannot take a subprocess, revisit —
  three consumers is a convention, five is a library.

## relayd Owns TLS

TLS terminates at relayd. Rails apps must use `config.assume_ssl = true` and must not force SSL themselves.

## Loopback App Ports

App ports are internal implementation details. Public ingress is 22, 25, 80, and 443; app ports stay behind relayd.

## `rails/apps.yml` Is Canonical

App status, domains, ports, and deploy scripts live in `RAILS/apps.yml`. `OPENBSD/deploy_inventory.json`, relayd, acme, NSD, and docs should agree with it.

## Copy-Tree Deploy

Rails app trees are copied to `/home/<app>/app`; shared code is copied to `/home/<app>/shared`. Do not assume symlinked repo layout on the VPS.

## MASTER Web Assets Must Be Explicit

Falcon does not hot-reload production assets. MASTER web changes require `rails assets:precompile` and `doas rcctl restart master`.

## Falcon Only (No Puma)

Production app servers on vm23 are Falcon (`falcon serve` in `/etc/rc.d/*`). Do not add Puma or run `bin/rails server` with Puma in production.

**Corrected 2026-08-13. Falcon does not honour `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA`, and this paragraph saying it did is why nobody looked.** The variable is not a Rails-wide switch: it is read by Solid Queue's *Puma plugin*, activated by `plugin :solid_queue` in `config/puma.rb`. None of the three apps has a `config/puma.rb` at all, so no plugin ever loaded and the variable was read by nothing.

Measured on vm23 that day: brgen had 1670 jobs enqueued, 0 finished, 0 registered processes and 0 recurring tasks; amber 103 and 0. No background job had ever run — including 150 `MessageExpirationJob`, so disappearing messages had never disappeared, and `PruneGuestUsersJob`, so 143,000 stale guest rows had never been pruned.

The variable is gone from all three `rc.d` files and the template. A Solid Queue worker under Falcon needs its own process: `etc/rc.d/<app>_jobs` exists for each app and is deliberately not enabled — read its footer, because vm23 is 1 GB and already cannot hold what it runs. `health_check.rb` fails when a queue has unfinished work and no registered process, so whichever way that goes it is visible.

**And the deploy was deleting the queue (2026-08-13).** `rails_prepare_secondary_dbs_as_app` in `RAILS/_database.sh` ran `db:schema:load:{cache,queue,cable}` on *every* deploy. Rails schema files declare `create_table … force: :cascade`, so a schema load drops each table and recreates it empty. Every deploy discarded every enqueued job. brgen's 1670 pending jobs were gone within the hour of the 2026-08-13 deploy — deleted, not run.

Secondary schemas are now loaded **once**, when the database does not already carry its tables. `rails db:prepare` on the preceding line already creates and migrates every configured database (`DatabaseTasks.prepare_all` walks `each_current_configuration`, not just primary); the explicit loop stays as a backstop, guarded. Pinned by `test_secondary_schema_load_is_guarded_by_an_initialisation_check`.

This mattered less than it looks like it should have, because nothing was ever going to run those jobs — and that is exactly why it needed fixing before the worker question is settled rather than after. A deploy that discards the password-reset emails enqueued while it was running is a worse bug than no worker at all.

## A Foreign Key To `users` Needs A `has_many` On `User` (2026-08-13)

Any table with an FK to `users` must have a matching association on `User` with an explicit `dependent:`. Without one, `User#destroy` raises `SQLite3::ConstraintException: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` — from the database, not from Rails, with nothing in the model to explain it.

`message_receipts` and `typing_indicators` were declared only on `Message` and `Conversation`. The consequence was not theoretical: account deletion was impossible for any user who had ever been in a conversation, which is precisely what the `deletion_scheduled_at` and `deleted_at` columns exist for, and `PruneGuestUsersJob` had never removed a row.

Two related traps found the same day:

- `db:migrate:status` cannot see a migration that ran and created nothing. `20260514120000_create_identity_and_trust_primitives` was recorded as applied with none of its seven tables present, and the migration system reported 0 pending. Compare `schema.rb`'s `create_table` list against the live tables instead.
- `in_batches(of: N, &:destroy_all)` over a relation carrying a JOIN does not survive deleting from that relation. It removed 3,832 of 143,339 eligible rows and returned success. Pluck ids, delete by id, re-query.

## Deploy Script Names

- `OPENBSD/OPERATOR.sh` — full vm23 OpenBSD installer (etc/usr/var, relayd, services)
- `RAILS/deploy.sh` — Rails app copy-tree deploy only (brgen, amber, bsdports)

## `/etc/doas.conf` Installs Only On A Deliberate Root Run (2026-08-02)

**Status:** accepted. Moved here from `data/debt.yml`, where it was the tail of a
closed entry — it is policy, not debt.

dev's rule is a five-variable `setenv` allowlist
(`I_UNDERSTAND_DNS_WIPE`, `I_UNDERSTAND_CONSOLE_RISK`, `RUN_PRODUCTION_SEEDS`,
`SKIP_MASTER_SCAN`, `MAIL_IMG_FMT`) — measured, not guessed: those are the
variables that scripts invoked under doas read and never assign themselves.
`keepenv` was removed from it because it preserves `RUBYOPT`/`RUBYLIB`/`GEM_HOME`
across the privilege boundary, which is arbitrary code execution as root by
construction. It stays on the root→root rule deliberately: it grants an attacker
nothing they do not already have, and stripping it would remove the environment
the outer dev→root hop just established from under the inner one.

Command scoping is **not** available as a hardening step here. The deploy
pipeline invokes `doas zsh` 27×, `doas sh` 8×, `doas ksh` 6× and `doas su` 2×,
and a root shell is equivalent to blanket root.

The file is installed by `OPERATOR.sh` or an explicit
`doas ksh validate_doas.ksh install <file> <reason>` — **never by a cron tick.**
The auto-heal that used to install it (`relayd-watchdog`, `config-drift-check`)
was root executing a dev-owned checkout, so it was removed; the consequence is
that a repo edit here does not reach the box by itself. A hardened `doas.conf`
sat in the repo for a day while production still ran the unhardened one, because
the installer everyone assumed existed did not work. Verify live with
`doas cat /etc/doas.conf`, not with the repo file. `vps_safety_gate.rb` pins the
repo copy.

## Release history (from RELEASE.md, merged 2026-07-10)

- **Gate chain restored** — repointed `require_relative "utf8"` refs after the `tools/` reorg; every gate had been crashing with `LoadError`.
- **CLI + probe bugs** — `Master::CommandRegistry.tree_lines` → `Master::Now::CommandRegistry.dispatch_tree`; nsaudit eager-loads + skips the kernel spine; smoke-web no longer crashes on a refused connection and skips cleanly off-VPS; asset drift regenerated.
- **baibl + blognet removed** — apps, relayd, acme, nsd (zones + DNSSEC keys), litestream, rc.d, inventories (`deploy_inventory.json`, `apps.yml`), gates, tests, and their vanity/megablog domains.
- **Web "tap to start" hardening** — platform-level guard in `chat/index.html.erb` blocks WebGL until primer tap.

## Open decisions (2026-07-10)

- **No staging environment.** vm23 is the only environment; a full staging copy would worsen 1-vCPU/1GB pressure (see `OPENBSD/resource_guard.sh`).
- **Auto-commit atomicity.** Unrelated automated commits to `main` sometimes bundle unrelated changes; scope commits to one concern each.

## Every gate carries its known-bad fixture — 2026-08-22

From arXiv 2608.04066 via the precision-ledger debt entry: a gate that has
never been run against an input it MUST flag is a claim, not an instrument —
the campaign's own instruments were wrong four times in two days and each
time only production or accident caught it. Doctrine, adopt-forward: a NEW
gate ships with the shape it must flag and the shape it must not
(tap_target_probe and focus_walk_probe are the exemplars; layout_search's
detector test is the retrofit shape); an EXISTING gate gets its pair when
next touched. Not a big-bang retrofit of 47 gates — the same enforce-forward
choice as FILE_SPRAWL.

## rcctl owns rc.conf.local, and litestream is off the boot list — 2026-08-25

**`/etc/rc.conf.local` cannot hold prose.** `rcctl enable/disable` rewrites the
file and re-sorts every line alphabetically. A fourteen-line rationale installed
at the top came back interleaved into nonsense on the next `rcctl disable` —
sentences from three paragraphs alternating, because each line sorted
independently. One comment line survives (`#` sorts to the top); anything longer
does not. The mirror in `OPENBSD/etc/rc.conf.local` carries exactly one line,
which says this, and points here.

It does not show up immediately: the scrambling happens on the next rcctl write,
not on install, so a drift check run straight after installing passes.

**litestream is removed from `pkg_scripts` and `rcctl disable`d.** It has never
replicated anything and cannot — litestream is not in OpenBSD ports, so there is
no package to add and no port to build. Left enabled it failed at every boot and
sat permanently in `rcctl ls failed`, which is the list `daily.out` prints under
"services that should be running but aren't". A list whose only entry can never
be fixed teaches everyone to skim it, and that list is how a real outage is
supposed to announce itself. It is empty now.

This is not a decision to go without off-host backups. `OPENBSD/bin/dr-pull`
runs nightly from the operator Mac under launchd, snapshots every
`production*.sqlite3` with `VACUUM INTO`, verifies `PRAGMA integrity_check` on
arrival and keeps the last 14. Verified 2026-08-25 by an actual restore drill:
posts and listings in the 24th's brgen snapshot matched live exactly. If
litestream is ever wanted, it needs a Go build on the box, which is a separate
decision with its own maintenance cost.
