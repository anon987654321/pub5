# amber and bsdports get shed and stay down, and nothing says so.
#
# relayd answers TLS on their behalf while they are down, so the outage reads as
# a hang rather than a 5xx and every other check on the box passes.
# OPENBSD/data/debt.yml has carried "amber_bsdports_stop_and_stay_down" for
# exactly this, and each occurrence was found by a person noticing amber was off
# — including 2026-08-14, when two concurrent deploys shed both and the guard
# did not bring either back.
#
# An earlier version of this rule asked whether resource_guard.sh's restore
# thresholds were still reachable, computed from its history log. Measured
# against the real 1550-tick log it stayed silent through the incident it was
# written for, so it was replaced rather than shipped: the gate does open, just
# rarely, and the log never records whether anything was shed at the time. The
# rule below observes the outage instead of modelling the mechanism.
