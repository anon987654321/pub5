# Return a core app's grown resident set to the box.

# resource_guard.sh sheds OPTIONAL="litestream bsdports amber" under pressure and
# restores them when it clears. It never touches CORE="master brgen", by design —
# those are the surfaces that must stay up. The consequence is that brgen's
# worker grows and nothing ever gives the memory back.
#
# Measured 2026-08-17. brgen's worker boots at 225M and had reached 355M, growing
# about 0.4M per request and never returning any of it. One restart:
#
#   before   brgen 355M   swap 1142M/1264M (91%)   free  43M
#   after    brgen 225M   swap  812M/1264M (64%)   free 249M
#
# 130M of resident set, and 330M of swap with it. That matters because the box
# was paging continuously at rest (vmstat pi 13-27/s while idle), and a page-in
# is what a visitor actually feels: amber's home measured 12.19s to first byte
# cold against 0.40s warm. On a low-traffic site nearly every visitor is the cold
# case.
