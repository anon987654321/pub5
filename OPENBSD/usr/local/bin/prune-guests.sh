# Nightly guest-row prune, one app at a time, when the box is actually quiet.
#
# This ran from daily.local for exactly one night and removed nothing. Three
# things were wrong and all three are fixed here.
#
# WHEN. daily.local runs at the tail of /etc/daily, which starts at 01:30 and
# has the box at load 4.12 by the time it gets there. PruneGuestUsersJob's own
# ceiling is 3.0, so the guard correctly refused and the job did nothing — the
# schedule and the guard were fighting each other. Its own cron slot at 04:20 is
# after daily(8) has finished and before the morning. And rather than skip a
# whole night if 04:20 happens to be busy, this waits for the load to fall,
# checking every two minutes for up to half an hour. One Rails boot either way.
#
# WHETHER. See prune_guests.rb: brgen's production logger does not write to
# stdout, so the run left no trace at all and could not be told from a crash.
# The result is printed now, with a timestamp, per app.
#
# HOME. cron's environment has HOME=/var/log (see the root crontab), and `su -m`
# preserves it, so bundler announced "`/var/log` is not writable" and relocated
# the home directory on every invocation. HOME is set explicitly below.
#
# bsdports has no `guest` column on users and is deliberately absent.
