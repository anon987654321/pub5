# amstrdam.nl was registered to us and served Amsterdam. It lapsed, dropped, and
# was re-registered by someone else on 2026-05-18 — GoDaddy, Cloudflare
# nameservers, 301 to an unrelated site. Nobody noticed for 81 days, because
# nothing was watching. lndon.uk dropped the same way. Four .uk domains sit in
# Nominet's grace window right now.
#
# nsd.conf lists the zones we serve. This asks each registry whether we still
# hold the name, and diffs the answer against a committed snapshot so a domain
# changing hands shows up as a reviewable diff instead of an outage.

# whois is rate-limited and several registries refuse queries from unknown
# clients. Anything we cannot determine is reported "unknown" and never counted
# as healthy — a monitor that reports green on a failed lookup is worse than none.
