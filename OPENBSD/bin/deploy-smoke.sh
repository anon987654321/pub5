#!/usr/bin/env sh
# One-page post-deploy smoke — run on vm23 after vps-deploy / restarts, or from a laptop.
#
# Usage:
#   sh OPENBSD/bin/deploy-smoke.sh              # auto: local+public if rcctl present
#   sh OPENBSD/bin/deploy-smoke.sh --public     # public HTTPS only
#   sh OPENBSD/bin/deploy-smoke.sh --local      # localhost ports + rcctl only
#   ALLOW_AMBER_DOWN=1 sh OPENBSD/bin/deploy-smoke.sh   # don't fail if amber is down
#   ALLOW_BSDPORTS_DOWN=1 sh OPENBSD/bin/deploy-smoke.sh  # same for bsdports
#
# Exit 0 only when required checks pass.
#
# bsdports was the hole this script existed to cover and did not: it had no local
# check at all and its public check was optional, so the one post-deploy gate that
# is supposed to notice a dead app could not fail on the app that was found dead
# (data/debt.yml: amber_bsdports_stop_and_stay_down). The contract test passed
# throughout, because it asserted the URL was present rather than required.
# A waiver is now a named variable per app, so waiving is a decision that shows up
# in the command line rather than a default nobody reads.
