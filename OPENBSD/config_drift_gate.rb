# Fails when a security-critical config on vm23 does not match its tracked
# OPENBSD/etc mirror byte-for-byte.
#
# The doas keepenv root-RCE stayed live in production for days while the repo and
# DEBT.md both called it fixed, because nothing ever compared the mirror against
# the running /etc. This is the check that would have caught it: the repo IS the
# live config, and when it is not, that is either an undeployed fix or a hand-edit
# nobody copied back, and both are the bug this gate names.
#
# Only VERBATIM-installed files are byte-compared. Templated installs and
# generated files are listed as excluded rather than diffed, because a difference
# there is expected, not drift.
#
# Run on vm23:              ruby34 OPENBSD/config_drift_gate.rb
# Run from a laptop:        SSH_HOST=dev@brgen.no ruby OPENBSD/config_drift_gate.rb --remote
# Off-VPS without --remote: skips cleanly.

# daily.local runs the INSTALLED copy at /usr/local/bin — root must not execute a
# file the dev user can rewrite — and from there `..` is /usr/local, so ETC was
# /usr/local/etc and every one of the eleven comparisons found no repo mirror.
# The gate warned eleven times, `next`ed past each without recording anything,
# and exited 0 reporting "clean (0 verbatim configs)". It had been reporting
# clean while comparing nothing.
#
# Reading the checkout is safe in a way that executing it is not: root compares
# bytes it never runs, so the escalation the installed copy exists to close stays
# closed. PUB4_ROOT first so a worktree or a test can point it somewhere else.
