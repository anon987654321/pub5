# Shedding used to fire on a single sample. vm23 is fine at rest — measured
# 2026-08-01 at 98% idle with zero paging (vmstat pi/po/fr all 0) — and only
# breaches transiently, when a deploy precompiles assets or an app cold-boots.
# One 5-minute sample landing inside that window took amber and bsdports down
# on essentially every deploy, and each restore then cost another tick apiece.
# Two consecutive breaches means a spike has to last past five minutes to count,
# which is the difference between "a deploy is running" and "the box is actually
# out of memory". The LOAD_CRIT path below is untouched and still acts on the
# first sample, because a genuine crisis should not wait.

# Recalibrated 2026-07-29 from the 916 ticks the history log had accumulated
# (2026-07-25..29), which is the dataset the note further down asked for.
# Observed: load p50=1.01 p75=1.69 p90=2.57; mem_avail p50=13 p75=24 p90=28.
# LOAD_RESTORE was 1.5, below the p50-p75 band, so restore needed the box to be
# quieter than it usually is. 2.0 sits between p50 and p75 and still stays well
# under LOAD_WARN, so shed and restore cannot chase each other.
LOAD_RESTORE=2.0
# Percent of physical RAM that must be AVAILABLE (free + buffer cache).
# History (2026-07-11): the guard originally measured vmstat's "pages free"
# alone, which excludes the OpenBSD buffer cache (~20% of RAM, reclaimable
# on demand). Any file I/O warming the cache dropped "free" below 12% while
# real available memory was fine, so the guard shed amber/bsdports
# on nearly every tick — a measurement artifact, not memory pressure. Free +
# Cache from top(1) is the honest availability signal. MEM_RESTORE > MEM_WARN
# gives hysteresis so shed/restore can't oscillate around one threshold.
#
# Recalibrated 2026-07-29 from the same 916-tick dataset. The hysteresis window
# was correct in shape but sat outside this box's operating range: median
# availability is 13%, one point above MEM_WARN, and MEM_RESTORE=20 was above
# the median entirely. Memory alone caused 334 of the 436 shed events, and the
# combined restore gate opened on 19% of ticks against shedding on 48% — so the
# drift was one-way and amber/bsdports stayed down for days rather than
# self-recovering, which is not what OPENBSD/CLAUDE.md claims. 8/14 keeps the
# same 6-point hysteresis gap, straddling p50 instead of sitting above it.
# Cost: more paging for the two optional apps. Swap is 1264M and was at 365M.
#
# Recalibrated again 2026-08-14, MEM_RESTORE 14 -> 10, from 1550 ticks
# (~5.4 days). The 2026-07-29 pass above was right for its dataset and the
# dataset moved: it measured mem_avail p50=13 p75=24 and set 14 to straddle the
# median. Today the same log reads **p50=9, p75=10, p90=16** — the box carries
# more than it did — so 14 had drifted back above p75, which is the exact
# condition that pass was fixing. Second occurrence of one failure.
#
# Measured against the real gate, not guessed: it opened on 7% of ticks, and
# memory alone blocked 89% of the non-shed ones. Sweeping the floor: 14 -> 7%,
# 12 -> 9%, 10 -> 23%, 9 -> 67%, 8 -> 83%. 10 is p75 and buys a restore
# opportunity roughly every 20 minutes instead of every 70.
#
# Why not 9, which opens the gate on two thirds of ticks: it leaves one point of
# hysteresis above MEM_WARN, so a shed at 7% would restore at 9% and shed again.
# 10 keeps a 2-point band. It is narrower than the 6 points this file has
# defended twice, and that is the deliberate trade — a wide band on a box whose
# whole operating range is 8-16% is a band with no room to sit in.
#
# To be exact about the symptom, because the first draft of this note overstated
# it: restore is not dead, it is slow. Both apps were shed at 05:55 on 2026-08-14
# and the shed list had cleared itself by 08:55 — three hours, spent waiting for
# availability to climb past 14 on a box that sits at 9. At 10 that wait is the
# 23%-of-ticks case, well under an hour.
#
# What made it recur is that nothing watched the window at all. health_check.rb
# now fails while anything the guard shed is still down, which is the outage
# rather than a theory about thresholds — an earlier version of that check did
# reason from this log about whether the gate was reachable, and measured against
# the real 1550 ticks it stayed silent through the very incident it was written
# for.
