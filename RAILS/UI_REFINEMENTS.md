# UI refinements — applied

Implementations for the 2026-07-18 proposal list plus the 2026-07-19 visual
opportunity pass. Canonical tokens: `RAILS/shared/design_tokens.yml`.
Ship verification: visual_contract + deploy.

_Last applied: 2026-08-01 (dead-wiring pass: install-prompt finally styled, pwa-standalone and offline-feed implemented in the shared engine, global `/` + ⌘K, token drift asserted against the committed tree)._

## Applied clusters

### A · Design tokens
- Dialect → consumer map documented at top of `design_tokens.yml`
- `shared_chrome` motion/elevation/semantic colors + `space_2xs`
- Social + luxury scales aligned with 2xs / success / warning / info
- Intent named: social soft vs face/bsdports CRT-flat zeros
- Light mode indigo/graphite (not Twitter blue)
- `vertical_accents` single source map (marketplace taupe, dating teal, maps cool blue, messenger slate-indigo)

### B · MASTER face (boot contract preserved)
- Primer phosphor title + mono consent styling (`face.css`)
- HUD tier hairlines, caption measure, chat caret mono
- Canvas `role="img"` + `aria-label`; `face-status-live` aria-live region
- 44px bar targets; permission button mono/zero-radius
- `406-unsupported-browser.html` action-first mono copy
- Error pages mono-aligned; reduced-motion primer glow off
- **Not changed:** WebGL/THREE before primer, `startEverything` path

### C · brgen shell
- Nav swiper `tablist`/`tab`/`aria-selected` + arrow-key roving tabindex
- Active underline + scroll-snap; 44px min hit
- City carousel → real `https://{domain}/` links; pause on reduced-motion + hidden tab
  — landed and **wrong**: 29 of those hosts do not resolve, so this row shipped a
  network that is not there onto every pageview. See `OPENBSD/data/debt.yml`
  `brgen_city_carousel_links_dead`. A landed row and a wrong-but-landed row look
  identical from a checklist, which is why this file cannot be the only record.
- Vertical accents single map in `_vertical_shell` only (no ui_refinements re-write)
- Graphite elevation (`#17161c` / `#211f28`) instead of pure black
- Flash/toast flat cards; post measure 66ch; skeleton utility; high-contrast media query
- Content-visibility with taller intrinsic for media cards
- Form error slot; empty-state partial; tap highlight accent; safe-area padding
- Messenger flat solid bubbles + mono timestamps + 44px send
- Playlist token-backed colors (no magic neon hex / decorative gradients)
- TV: no CSS filter grade / radial glow; solid stage + hairline
- Maps: cool cartography blue-gray, solid accent buttons

### D · amber luxury
- `luxury-light-tokens` / `luxury-dark-tokens` wired in `_variables.scss`
- Caprasimo display, editorial grid (collapses on small screens)
- Placeholder tiles with flat diagonal hatch; sustainability grade chip
- Empty/skeleton/high-contrast floor

### E · bsdports
- `openbsd_wscons` green terminal tokens on `:root`/`body`
- Dense mono rows, advisory tags, secondary green meta-only
- Empty-state CRT (radius 0), mono skeleton, sticky port meta, tabular nums
- prefers-contrast more

### F–O · Shared floor
- `_empty_state.scss` + `_empty_state.html.erb` across all three apps
- Offline Retry button + Stimulus `retry`
- Error pages graphite/indigo dialect (not Twitter blue)
- Edge grips 44px hit area; forced-colors ported into x_shell
- Search skeleton loading shell
- WIRING_NOTES dialect truth (soft social / CRT face+bsdports / single-column + edge swiper)

## 2026-08-01 dead-wiring pass (landed)

Everything here rendered, raised nothing, and did nothing — the failure shape this
file's checklists cannot catch, because a landed row and an inert one look identical
from the outside. Full accounting in `OPENBSD/data/debt.yml:rails_silent_wiring_breaks`.

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| `.install-prompt` styled at all — the shared partial rendered in three apps and none styled it, so revealing it showed unstyled text in document flow | Landed |
| `pwa-standalone` implemented (`[data-pwa-display]` on `<html>`, safe-area inset, install prompt hidden once installed) and `data-pwa-key` given a reader | Landed |
| `offline-feed` moved brgen-local → shared, so amber item cards actually snapshot | Landed |
| `form-submit#lock` written (deferred a tick so the submitter's own value still posts) and attached to the two forms that called it | Landed |
| `content_for :body_attrs` yielded; push badge clears via `data-push-seen` rather than an action `<body>` could never resolve | Landed |
| Tv chat + video notes broadcast with explicit `partial:`/`target:`; videos/show subscribes to its own stream | Landed |
| Three broadcasts into streams with no subscriber removed (Reaction, TimestampedComment, SecurityAdvisory) | Landed |
| `stimulus_wiring` gate: every `data-controller` and `ev->id#method` in ERB resolves, 326 checks | Landed |

## Intentionally residual (product/ops, not pure CSS)

| Item | Why residual |
|------|----------------|
| Full visual_contract capture matrix | Needs running apps + Ferrum/Chrome on Ruby 3.4/VPS |
| True ML rembg/segmentation | Postpro bridge only; models are infra |
| Per-glyph typewriter captions vs fade | Product choice — left as fade-capable CSS |
| Council multi glyph set | Needs face JS state machine work beyond style |
| Token CSS auto-gen test fail-on-drift | Landed 2026-08-01 — `design_tokens_test.rb` now asserts the *committed* `face.css`, `_dialect_tokens.scss` and dialect maps against `design_tokens.yml`. Every drift predicate already existed and every test proved it worked on a tmpdir fixture; nothing checked the real tree, so the generator could go unrun for weeks with a green suite |
| Demo wardrobe seed 6–8 items | Already done and this row was stale — `Amber::AmberDemoSeeder` seeds 17 items and 3 outfits idempotently, covered by `amber/test/lib/amber_demo_seeder_test.rb` |
| Global `/` hotkey search chrome | Landed 2026-08-01 — `/` and `⌘/Ctrl-K` now reach the search on every page of all three apps. bsdports had neither: its `search-hotkey` was a local controller bound to the ports index only, and its layout registered no hotkey controller at all. `feed-hotkey` moved onto the bsdports body (with `hotkeys.*` in en/nb), Cmd/Ctrl-K joined the shared controller, and the local copy is deleted |
| Per-app PWA monochrome icons | Landed (brgen/amber/bsdports + manifests) |
| Full ERB class-soup → bare semantic HTML | Multi-PR product surface; partial via shared primitives |
| Full i18n of brgen chrome strings | Core home/auth/nav/empty + full primary nav landed; residual vertical product copy remaining |
| Amber/bsdports chrome i18n (auth, layout, guest home, ports search) | Landed 2026-07-31 |
| Space-not-lines TV/nearby/empty/amber dash | Landed 2026-07-31 |
| design_rules pixel_perfection alignment (no ornamental box-shadow in polish wave) | Landed 2026-07-31 — floating chrome uses border/surface contrast |
| Vertical empty + search i18n (marketplace, TV, playlist, takeaway, maps, amber, bsdports) | Landed 2026-07-31 |
| Type/pixel alignment: --text-title token, page-header 48px rhythm, font var(--font) | Landed 2026-07-31 |
| MASTER autonomy: design_rules.ui_polish + chrome_i18n_lint + surface rules | Landed 2026-07-31 — see MASTER/docs/UI_POLISH_PLAYBOOK.md |
| Exhaustive model/request coverage | Expand when touching domains (Boy Scout) |
| In-process `release` / `rails_runtime` / `visual_contract` | Still subprocess by design |
| SCSS `_ui_refinements*` merge into domain partials | Next touch Boy Scout |
| Horizon features (pgvector, live video, Solidus full) | `apps.horizon.yml` agent-ignore |

These are tracked in `MASTER/DEBT.md` / `apps.horizon.yml` when they grow past polish.
