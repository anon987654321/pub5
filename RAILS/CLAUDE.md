# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Scope: `RAILS/`. Repo-wide rules are in `../CLAUDE.md`; authority order is
`MASTER/data/soul.yml` > `MASTER/data/rules.yml` > `../CLAUDE.md` > this file.

This file is a pointer. `README.md` in this directory is the maintained
long-form reference (gate tables, rendered-gate semantics, deploy blockers,
subdomain map) and `apps.yml` is feature truth — do not restate either here.
The root `CLAUDE.md` was once deleted wholesale for exactly that drift.

## Commands

```zsh
ruby RAILS/gates/runner.rb --all          # every registered gate
ruby RAILS/gates/runner.rb --list         # gate names
ruby RAILS/gates/runner.rb production     # one gate, or a composite
ruby RAILS/test/<name>_test.rb            # one contract test — bare ruby, no bundle
cd RAILS/<app> && bin/ci                  # per-app RuboCop, Brakeman, bundler-audit, tests
cd RAILS/<app> && bin/rails test test/models/item_test.rb:42   # one app test
RAILS/bin/triangle up                     # boot all 4 surfaces on the ports gates probe
npm ci && npm run build:pwa               # rebuild the Workbox service worker
```

`RAILS/test/*.rb` are standalone Minitest files run under bare `ruby` — they read
source as text and never boot Rails. App tests under `RAILS/<app>/test/` need the
app bundle. Ruby 3.4.9 is pinned by `.ruby-version` at the repo root and in each
app directory, so app commands resolve the same interpreter from any cwd.

Which check proves the work: source change → the gate that owns it
(`runner.rb --list`); app code → that app's `bin/ci`; anything measuring rendered
layout → `RAILS/bin/triangle up` first, or the live half silently passes having
measured nothing.

## Architecture

**One engine, three apps.** `shared/` is the `pub4-shared` gem, mounted by
`path: '../shared'` in each app's Gemfile. It carries models, controllers, views,
Stimulus controllers, policies and lints that all three apps share. Concerns come
in through `Shared.concern(:Votable)`, routes through an `instance_eval` of
`shared/config/routes/social.rb` in each app's `routes.rb`. A change in `shared/`
lands in three apps at once — check all three before assuming a fix is local.

**Shared deploys as a sibling, not a subdirectory.** The copy-tree deploy puts the
tracked app at `/home/<app>/app` and its own copy of the engine at
`/home/<app>/shared`. Every app vendors a separate copy; syncing to the wrong one
makes precompile a silent no-op. `Pub4::DeployPaths` resolves OPENBSD tools across
both source-checkout and copy-tree shapes — never compute paths from `Rails.root`.

**brgen's verticals are mountable engines**, not namespaced controllers:
`brgen/engines/{marketplace,dating,playlist,takeaway,tv}`. Subdomain constraints
in `brgen/config/routes.rb` via `Brgen::DomainRegistry` map `markedsplass`,
`dating`, `tv` and the rest onto them. Messenger and the MASTER relay are not
engines. Tooling that globs `<app>/app/**` misses engine code — four scanners
stopped seeing 57 views when the verticals moved, and the falling finding count
read as improvement rather than blindness.

**Gates are declared once.** Every gate is a row in `gates/gates.yml` carrying its
`require`, `Deploy::*` class, pass line, and parent composite; `runner.rb` and
`OPENBSD/lib/gate_environment.rb` both read that file by gate name. Adding a gate
is one row — not a new script. Most run in-process returning a
`Deploy::GateResult`; only `release`, `rails_runtime` and `visual_contract`
subprocess.

**Source gates read text; rendered gates measure Chrome.** The `rendered_suite`
family drives real Chrome over CDP through `gates/support/cdp_session.rb` — stdlib
only, no ferrum/selenium, because gates run under bare `ruby` outside any app
bundle. Without Chrome they degrade to warnings rather than failing, so a green
run does not by itself mean anything was measured.

**MASTER governs this tree.** `cd MASTER && ruby bin/gate` runs the same
`/scan → /fix → /critique → /review` chain over `RAILS/` that MASTER runs on
itself, and `/fix` mutates the working tree. `MASTER_GATE_SCAN_ONLY=1` for
preflight.

## Traps

- **Visual/CSS work:** read `shared/WIRING_NOTES.md` "Visual design system" first.
  The layout chrome contract every surface shares is `shared/LAYOUT.md`.
  Tokens live in `shared/app/assets/stylesheets/_dialect_tokens.scss`; flat only,
  no shadow/blur/glow. Most layout "bugs" here are stale deployed CSS — diff live
  against source before changing anything.
- **Stale fragment caches:** `update_column` skips `updated_at`, so `[record, …]`
  cache keys do not bust and a page keeps rendering the old value while the
  console shows the new one.
- **`visual_contract` baselines are gitignored** and overwritten on read — a
  regression reports once and becomes the baseline. `layout_snapshot` commits
  reviewable rect/style JSON instead; accept new baselines only under
  `GATE_SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1`.
- **Deploy sheds amber and bsdports**, and TLS keeps answering, so the outage
  looks like `curl 000` rather than a 5xx. Check ports 61352 and 47312 directly.
- **Horizon features** in `apps.horizon.yml` are `agent: ignore` — do not
  implement unprompted.

## Editing frontend code

Stimulus packages are vendored, never fetched from a CDN; `shared/frontend/STIMULUS_COMPONENTS_BASELINE.md` explains the gate that holds it and why a `pin` costs a `modulepreload`.

The visual design is deliberate and the user is a trained architect. Restore or
ask; never invent a layout fix. Hidden swipe-reveal navigation is intended.

Split large mixed HTML/CSS/JS documents before editing them, and never ask a
model to rewrite one unless the output is a minimal unified diff. Structure goes
in `app/views`, styles in `app/assets/stylesheets`, Stimulus controllers in
`app/javascript/controllers` (or `shared/frontend/` when more than one app uses
them), and chart config, animations, fonts and SVG icons each in their own file.

Extract styling verbatim. Do not normalize, minify, rename classes, drop vendor
prefixes, collapse custom animations into generic transitions, or replace CSS
custom properties with literals while moving code. Do not alter chart options
while editing chart data. Prefer an additive class over changing an existing one,
and leave `PROTECTED` sections alone unless the task names them.

Scanners hold the parts of this that one file can show: `NO_JQUERY`,
`NO_INLINE_ASSETS_IN_SHELL`, `NO_MULTIPLE_LANGUAGES`, `NO_INLINE_STYLES`,
`MAGIC_COLOR`. The rest are properties of a diff, so they are checked by reading
one. Numbers come from `shared/design_tokens.yml`, never from a document.
