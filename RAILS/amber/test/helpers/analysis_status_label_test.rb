# "Pending media" is a promise, and on vm23 it is one amber cannot keep: no Solid
# Queue supervisor is resident for this app (debt.yml multi_app_ram — 1 GB, one
# resident worker, and it is brgen's), so the rc.d footer measured 103 jobs
# enqueued and 0 finished. A garment uploaded today shows "Pending media" for as
# long as the account exists.
#
# The label now asks whether anything is going to pick the job up. Same doctrine
# as payment_honesty and affiliate_honesty: say the state, not the intention.
#
# Three of these need solid_queue_processes, and no app in this tree has that
# table in its test databases — brgen has declared four test databases all along
# and its queue schema has never been loaded either, because nothing in any suite
# had touched those tables until this file. They skip with that reason rather
# than passing vacuously, and they start running the day db:prepare loads
# db/queue_schema.rb for the test environment.
