# ApplicationRecord sets strict_loading_by_default = true, but
# Shared::CascadingAssociationsLoad — declared three lines below it — sets
# strict_loading: false on every has_many/has_one carrying a :destroy,
# :destroy_async, :delete_all or :nullify cascade. So on Item, the four
# associations that look most dangerous (declutter_review, declutter_challenges,
# sustainability_metric, garment_embedding) are all exempt and do NOT raise.
#
# `belongs_to :user` is not wrapped, and does. That is the read that bites jobs:
# they have no request spec, and a job that raises on its first record
# never does its work. Both jobs below read item.user.
