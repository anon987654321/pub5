  # Three tables carry a foreign key to outfits and this model declared none of
  # them, so `OutfitsController#destroy` raised ActiveRecord::InvalidForeignKey
  # — a 500 on the delete button — for any outfit that had ever been worn or
  # planned. The schema has the constraint; only the model did not know.
  #
  # The two dependent options are different on purpose:
  #
  #   wear_logs        nullify. A wear happened. Deleting the outfit deletes the
  #                    grouping, not the history, and every garment's times_worn
  #                    already counts it. WearLog#outfit is `optional: true`,
  #                    which is the same statement from the other side.
  #   planned_outfits  destroy. A plan to wear an outfit that no longer exists
  #                    is not a plan.
