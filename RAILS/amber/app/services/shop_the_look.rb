    # unattributed link still works, and inventing tracking is what
    # affiliate_honesty forbids) and when the owner already pasted a tracked URL.

    # is exactly what an ad blocker removes and this path does not depend on JS.

    # Why the remote feed cannot answer, or nil when it can.
    #
    # Not two silent `return []` guards. The second was unconditional in amber:
    # the feed client lives in brgen's app/services and is not loaded in this
    # process, so setting TRADEDOUBLER_TOKEN in
    # /etc/amber.env passed the first gate, hit the second, and produced nothing
    # — configuration with no reader, reporting nothing. Naming the reason is
    # what made that visible instead of empty.
    #
    # It is `Shared::Tradedoubler` now and amber loads it, so a token set here
    # reaches a client that can answer. The guard stays because the reasons are
    # still distinct and still worth telling apart: no token, no client, no
    # query. It is no longer the one that is always true.
