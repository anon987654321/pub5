# Cleaning, organising and storing guidance for a wardrobe.
#
# The original Amber specification asked for "tips for cleaning, organizing, and
# storing your wardrobe using architecture, interior design and zen minimalism
# combined with smart algorithms". `WardrobeAnalytics#tips` covered none of that
# — it is five wear-and-declutter nudges — so this service owns the other three
# registers and reads the wardrobe to decide which apply.
#
# Four registers, each named for the discipline it borrows from:
#
#   :care      cleaning and repair, driven by lifecycle state, WardrobeItem
#              condition, and material care rules
#   :storage   what to fold, what to hang, what to archive out of season
#   :zoning    architecture's reach zones — prime reach for what is worn daily,
#              high and deep storage for what is not
#   :restraint zen minimalism — rod density, duplicates, one-in-one-out
#
# Every tip is a rule with a stated principle and the wardrobe evidence that
# triggered it. No LLM is involved; `source` says `rules` so the UI can say so
# too, the same honesty contract `WardrobeAnalytics#tips_source` already keeps.
#
# The copy lives under `closet.tips.<id>` in the locale files rather than in
# this file. Amber defaults to Norwegian, so a rules engine that only speaks
# English produces a page half in each language.
