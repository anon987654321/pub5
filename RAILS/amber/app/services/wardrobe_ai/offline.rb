# What amber answers with when there is no model to ask.
#
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY is unset on most machines and on vm23 by default, so these
# are not an edge case — they are what the wardrobe pages render most of the
# time, and `available?` being false has to stay a working product rather than
# an error state. Split out of wardrobe_ai.rb when that file passed its
# file-length ceiling, along the seam that was already there: everything here
# is deterministic Ruby over the user's own items, and everything left in
# WardrobeAi either calls a model or decides whether it can.
#
# Included rather than extracted to an object: these read `user` and the item
# scopes off the instance, and threading those through a collaborator would buy
# indirection and nothing else. They stay private to WardrobeAi.
