# frozen_string_literal: true

# Ranks garments by how much this wardrobe's owner actually likes them.
#
# The original Amber specification asked for Mix & Match carousels "influenced
# by its ever-evolving knowledge of your taste and preference". Two things make
# that knowledge evolve, and this service reads both:
#
#   Declared taste  — `StylePreference` rows the owner (or the style profile
#                     form) wrote. `kind: :avoid` counts against a garment no
#                     matter which sign its weight carries.
#   Revealed taste  — joy flag, wear count, wear recency, life phase. What
#                     someone reaches for is a stronger signal than what they
#                     say, so behaviour carries more of the score than words.
#
# Scores are 0.0–1.0 and explainable: `explain` returns the reasons that moved
# a garment, which is what the dressing room shows under each zone.
class TasteRanker
  # Weights sum to 1.0. Behaviour (joy + wear + recency) is 0.62 of the score;
  # declared preferences are 0.24; life phase is 0.14.
