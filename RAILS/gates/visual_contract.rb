  # Capture console output through a shim installed before page scripts run.
  #
  # The previous implementation guarded on `driver.manage.respond_to?(:logs)` and
  # returned [] otherwise, which reads as careful degradation. It was not: the
  # installed selenium-webdriver is 4.46.0 and `Manager#logs` does not exist in
  # any of the three app bundles — grepped, not assumed. So the guard was always
  # false, this always returned [], and the console-error count in every capture
  # has been a structural zero. A gate that counts console errors and can never
  # see one reports clean forever.
  #
  # BiDi is the supported replacement and it is a large dependency to take on for
  # one number. execute_cdp is already available on the Chrome driver, so the shim
  # goes in through Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument — which runs before any
  # page script, and is the only reason load-time messages are catchable at all.
  # Reading it back after load is then an ordinary execute_script.
  #
  # window.onerror is included because an uncaught exception never passes through
  # console.error, and it is the failure most worth catching.
