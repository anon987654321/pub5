    # _root.scss includes brgen-old-dark-tokens, whose later :root wins — so the
    # real surfaces are #000000 and #1a1a1a. Every vertical finding was measured
    # against a background the app never renders.
    #
    # It mattered in both directions. marketplace #8c7a5e reads 3.92:1 on
    # social.surface_elevated and 4.19 on the real one — still failing, so the
    # lift was right for the wrong reason. messenger #6b7fd7 reads 4.37 on
    # social's and 4.68 on the real one — it already passed, and was "corrected"

    # The comment on MODE_PREFIX above states the rule this enforces — pairing a
    # light-mode foreground against a dark-mode surface invents a combination
    # the UI never renders — and MODE_PREFIX cannot reach these, because
    # vertical_accents carry no light_/dark_ prefix. So the mode is read from
    # the stylesheets instead of from the key.
    #
    # marketplace is the case. --vertical-marketplace-accent-hover has exactly
    # one use in the whole tree, at _vertical_marketplace.scss:73, under
    # `:root[data-theme="light"]` — and design_tokens.yml says why in the note
    # above the token: the accent is a background carrying dark ink, so small
    # text in this vertical wears `hover`, and only the light theme swaps to it.
    # On its actual ground it measures 6.03:1. Paired against brgen_old_dark's
    # #000000 and #1a1a1a it reads 3.48 and 2.89, and reported two AA failures
    # for a combination that cannot be rendered.
    #
    # Raising the ceiling to absorb those would have been worse than the finding:
    # contrast_below_aa is 0 precisely so a real one is visible the day it lands.

    # Values of a custom property that survive the cascade.

    # read_custom_properties below answers "is this property read anywhere",
    # which is necessary and not sufficient. A dialect can declare a value, the
    # property can be read all over the tree, and the value still never reach a
    # pixel because a later rule at the same specificity overwrites it.
    #
    # That is what social.accent does. Every app emits `:root { --accent:
    # #897dda }` from the shared baseline and then a second `:root` further down
    # with its own dialect — #f2f2f2 for brgen's BRGEN_OLD grayscale, #7e6e55 for
    # amber's luxury, #63c363 for bsdports' wscons. Same specificity, later wins,
    # so the social value is shadowed in all three. Measured: with the accent
    # "corrected" locally and production still on the old value, both computed
    # --accent as #f2f2f2. Identical. The contrast finding that prompted the
    # change was about a colour nothing paints.
    #
    # Deliberately reads the built CSS, unlike read_custom_properties, which
    # excludes builds/ so a stale artifact cannot vote. Cascade order only exists
    # after compilation — the SCSS says which mixins exist, not which one lands
    # last in a given app. The freshness risk is real and is covered by
    # `build_all_css.rb --check` and the generated_asset gate; if those are
    # skipped this reads yesterday's answer.
    #
    # Scope: plain `:root` shadowing, which is the demonstrated defect. It does
    # not resolve @media, [data-theme], or body-class scopes — a value at a more
    # specific selector (body.vertical-marketplace) is treated as painting,
    # which is correct for those and conservative elsewhere.
