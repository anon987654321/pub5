    # It is one subject across three methods — pair every declared token against
    # the backgrounds it is actually painted on, score them WCAG and APCA, then
    # judge the two counts against gates/data/css_budget.yml — and the maths it
    # calls lives next door in gates/support/design_metrics/contrast.rb, which
    # was split off the same subject at the other layer.

    # A module included back into the gate, so it keeps @result, @tokens and the
    # private helpers it shares with the other twelve checks.

      # The old list checked text/bg and text/surface only, and passed — while
      # social.accent/bg sat at 4.37 and `color: var(--accent)` was being used as
      # a text colour in dozens of rules. Anything the author forgets to list is
      # invisible to a list.

      # Severity is deliberately soft here: this enumerates pairings that *could*
      # occur, and a token pair the UI never actually renders is not a defect.
