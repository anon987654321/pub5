  #
  # 2026-07-29 produced nine production faults and most of them were already
  # understood — they had never shipped. brgen's deploys had been failing
  # on one drifted var() fallback since 2026-07-25, so the takeaway 500 fix and
  # the tab-bar overlap fix sat in the repo, correct, for four days. Later the
  # same day two more fixes (every TV channel page 404ing, an invisible primary
  # button on the front page) stayed committed-but-undeployed until someone
  # thought to ask.
  #
  # Every one of those was findable with two facts we already had: the SHA in
  # /var/db/pub4/last_deploy_<app>.json, and `git log <sha>..HEAD -- <paths>`.
  # Nothing was watching them. This does.
  #
  # Deliberately NOT a soft skip when the stamps are missing. Off the deploy
  # host there are no stamps and this gate genuinely cannot judge, so it says so
  # rather than reporting success it has not earned.
  #
  # A warning was not enough to carry that: `GateResult#ok?` only asked about
  # hard failures, so the shim still printed "ok: no deploy drift detected"
  # directly beneath "Nothing was checked." `GateResult#inconclusive!` is the
  # third state that fixes it, and the sixteen other gates in this suite that
  # passed on an absent precondition now use it too.
