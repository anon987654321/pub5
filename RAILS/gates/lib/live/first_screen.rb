  # The first screen carries a skip link, a main landmark and an h1, and the
  # stylesheets declare a tap minimum. Both halves are text: the markup is
  # fetched and matched, the tap minimum is grepped out of SCSS.
  #
  # It was called layout_geometry, which claimed something it does not do. It
  # measures no boxes. A tap minimum declared in a stylesheet says nothing about
  # whether the element carrying it is overlapped, clipped or overridden at this
  # breakpoint — RenderedGeometryGate is what measures that, in a browser, and
  # its own header records that this gate is the one it was named after.
  #
  # The distinction is worth the rename because the old pair invited the reading
  # that touch targets were already covered. They were not, and this gate had
  # already been caught measuring nothing once: the tree writes
  # `min-height: var(--tap-min)` and the pattern here matched only the literal
  # `44px`, so it passed on every app while checking no app.
  #
  # A source-and-markup floor is still worth having. It runs in seconds without
  # Chrome, which is what makes it a floor rather than a substitute.

    # grepped for the literal `min-height: 44px`, so the gate was measuring a
    # spelling rather than a geometry and firing on files that satisfied it.
    #
    # Accepting the token on its name alone would be the opposite mistake — a
    # sheet that had quietly dropped to 30px would pass — so TAP_MIN_PX re-reads
