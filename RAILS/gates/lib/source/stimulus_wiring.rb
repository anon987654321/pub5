  # Resolves every Stimulus reference in ERB against something that exists.
  #
  # Four dead references shipped and survived a full audit pass because nothing
  # checks this class of wiring: it does not raise, it does not log, the page
  # renders, and the feature is absent. `data-controller="pwa-standalone"`
  # named a controller nobody wrote (amber + bsdports layouts);
  # `data-controller="offline-feed"` named a brgen-local file from amber, whose
  # importmap eager-loads only its own directory; `submit->form-submit#lock`
  # named a method that was never added. Each was invisible until someone grepped
  # for it.
  #
  # Two things are checked, and the second is the one that needs care:
  #
  #   1. Every identifier in data-controller resolves to a registration — either
  #      an application.register("name", …) in stimulus_boot.js, a
  #      @stimulus-components entry in its table, or a file in the app's own
  #      controllers/ directory (eagerLoadControllersFrom derives the identifier
  #      from the filename).
  #
  #   2. Every `event->identifier#method` names a method that exists — but only
  #      when the identifier maps to a first-party file we can read. Vendored
  #      components are registered from node_modules-style bundles and are not
  #      introspected; claiming a missing method there would be a guess.
