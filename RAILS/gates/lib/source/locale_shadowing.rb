  # An app's own translation, overridden by the shared engine, silently.
  #
  # `shared/` is mounted by every app, and its locale files are merged with the
  # app's. When both define a key, one value renders and the other is dead — and
  # nothing anywhere says which. The failure is invisible by construction: the
  # string is present in the app's own nb.yml, in the app's own repo, and the
  # page shows something else.
  #
  # Which one wins was measured rather than reasoned about, by booting bsdports
  # and reading I18n.load_path for a key defined in both:
  #
  #   idx 15  shared/config/locales/social.nb.yml   "Hopp til hovedinnhold"
  #   idx 17  bsdports/config/locales/nb.yml        "Hopp til innholdet"
  #   idx 24  shared/config/locales/social.nb.yml   "Hopp til hovedinnhold"
  #
  # The shared engine's locale path is in load_path TWICE, and the second
  # registration lands after every app's own locales. Last write wins, so shared
  # always does. The first reasoning attempt — engines load before the app,
  # therefore the app wins — was correct about Rails and wrong about this tree,
  # and would have shipped a gate that named the wrong file as dead.
  #
  # The visible cost today is nav.brand_home: brgen sets "Brgen home", amber sets
  # "Amber home", shared sets "Home", and all three render "Home".
  #
  # Keys where both files agree are not reported. They are redundant rather than
  # wrong, there are ~180 of them, and a gate whose output is mostly harmless
  # duplication is one people learn to skip.

    # A key with no value deletes whatever a later merge would have kept.

    # Removing the last child of a YAML mapping leaves the parent behind as a
    # bare `nav:`, which parses as nil — and in I18n's deep merge nil REPLACES a
    # Hash rather than being ignored. shared/ loads after every app, so one such
    # key there wiped all 48 nav entries in brgen, 23 in amber and 8 in bsdports.
    # Every navigation label in every app, from deleting one line.

    # The shadowing check above could not see it: it compares values that
    # disagree, and a key resolving to nothing disagrees with nobody. So it stayed
    # green while three apps rendered "Translation missing" everywhere.

    # Only shared/ can do this damage, because only shared/ loads last. An empty
    # key in an app's own file is a dead declaration rather than a weapon, so it
