  # Two facts about a rendered page that no source check can see, and that this
  # repo got wrong on 2026-08-10 in both cases:
  #
  #   1. brgen served its LIGHT palette. :root declared the dark BRGEN_OLD tokens
  #      and had for months, but shared/_tokens.scss ends with
  #      `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) { :root:not([data-theme=dark]) }`,
  #      which outranks a bare :root. On any client whose OS prefers light — the
  #      default on most installs — that block won. The app declared dark and
  #      served light, and both are valid CSS, so nothing reported it.
  #
  #   2. The chat tab is in a different corner on different surfaces. Two of
  #      those differences are deliberate and documented; the point of this gate
  #      is that a THIRD one would look identical from the source.
  #
  # Both are geometry and computed style, so both need a browser. The lesson from
  # the same day is that this is exactly where gates go quiet: every rendered
  # gate here calls skipped_live when a port is closed, and a skip is a warning
  # rather than a failure unless GATE_REQUIRE_LIVE=1. So a green run on a laptop
  # with nothing booted means nothing was measured. This gate follows that
  # convention rather than inventing a second one — but it records what it
  # measured, so a half-blind run does not read like a real one.
  class RenderedInvariants
    # Surfaces to visit, and the theme each is expected to serve.
    #
    # amber is deliberately absent: its :root includes luxury-light-tokens, so
    # light is its design rather than a bug, and asserting dark there would be
    # this gate telling the truth about the wrong intent.
    # theme: here is the product decision, mirroring ApplicationHelper's
    # LIGHT_VERTICALS (marketplace, maps, takeaway read light — operator,
    # 2026-08-24). It is duplicated rather than read because this gate runs under
    # bare ruby with no app booted; check_theme compares it to what the page
    # actually declares, so the two drifting apart fails here rather than going
    # quiet the way it did when this list still called both storefronts dark.

    # Two separate questions, and conflating them is what made this gate wrong.
    #
    # It used to hold one expected theme per host and compare the rendered luma to
    # that. Then markedsplass, maps and takeaway became light on purpose (operator,
    # 2026-08-24: storefronts read light, and that is a product decision, not a
    # preference) and this list did not move with them. The gate reported two
    # deliberate surfaces as defects and told anyone reading to "fix" them by
    # pinning data-theme="dark" — undoing the decision on the gate's say-so.
    #
    # So the palette question is now asked against the page's own declaration:
    # whatever <html data-theme> says, the pixels have to agree. That is the bug
    # this gate was written for — a prefers-color-scheme block outranking a bare
    # :root, so the served palette contradicted the declared one — and it stays
    # caught without the gate holding an opinion about which surface is which.

    # The product decision is still pinned, separately, by SURFACES: an accidental
    # flip of surface_theme is a real regression and would otherwise pass here,
    # since a flipped page agrees with itself perfectly.
