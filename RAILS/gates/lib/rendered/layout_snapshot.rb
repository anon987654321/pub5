  # Structural pixel-perfect: a committed, diffable JSON baseline of what the
  # browser laid out, compared per element.
  #
  # This replaces the PNG path as the *assertion*, for three reasons the
  # existing visual_contract_gate cannot work around:
  #
  #   1. Its baseline is whatever PNG happens to be on disk at the destination
  #      path, and it overwrites that file with the new capture. A regression
  #      is reported once and then becomes the baseline.
  #   2. RAILS/visual_contract/*.png is gitignored, so on a fresh checkout or
  #      any CI machine every cell compares against nothing.
  #   3. Exact pixel equality fires on font antialiasing and GPU differences,
  #      so where it does work it cries wolf.
  #
  # A rect/style snapshot is immune to all three: it is text, it is tracked, it
  # survives a machine change, and a diff reads "the buy bar moved up 3px and
  # lost 4px of height" instead of "8,214 pixels changed".
  #
  # Baselines are accepted only under GATE_SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 — deliberately NOT
  # under GATE_AUTOFIX, because "make the failure go away by blessing the new
  # layout" is precisely the self-healing behaviour this gate exists to remove.

    # The list named `live-item` and `post-meta`, which the live surface has
    # never rendered -- its markup is `live-card-meta` / `live-card-actions`
    # under a `#post_<id>` anchor. So 100 of that baseline's 114 elements were
    # seeded post IDs and the filter caught none of them: the surface drifted on
    # every reseed, and the only available fix was to re-record it, which is the
    # habit this filter exists to prevent. Match the record anchor itself
    # (`#post_2206`, `#comment_88`) rather than trying to enumerate the class
    # names hung off it, since that is the part that is actually a database id.
    # A generated id is the same problem as a database id and worse: Swiper mints
    # `#swiper-wrapper-89838f8a227d649d` fresh on every page load, so the key of
    # every element beneath a carousel changed between two runs of this gate with
    # nothing touched in between. Re-recording could never converge, because the
    # next run invents new ids again. Matched by shape — a hex run of eight or
    # more — rather than by library name, so the next widget that does this is

    # the tab is 94px or 104px wide depending on visitor state, and the two
    # alternate between runs of this gate. The partial's own comment records an

    # stopped the visible relabel without making the width one value.
