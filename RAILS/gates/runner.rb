# Every gate is declared in gates.yml and nowhere else. Most run in-process via
# a Deploy::* class returning a GateResult; three keep a subprocess because they
# shell out or forward arguments. Composite gates already run their leaves, so
# --all drops a leaf whose composite is also selected.

# Forces Encoding.default_external = UTF_8. Seven of the per-gate scripts this
# runner replaced required it and it was not delegation: under a C locale --
# which is exactly how OPENBSD/integrity_gate.rb invokes them, deliberately --
# Ruby defaults file reads to US-ASCII and every gate that reads UTF-8 source
# or config fails. Dropping it silently broke production, frontend and
# domain_align inside the integrity chain while they passed standalone.
