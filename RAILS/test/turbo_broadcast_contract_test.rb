# A Turbo broadcast that names a partial which does not exist does not raise where
# anyone sees it. `broadcast_*_later_to` enqueues a job; the job raises
# ActionView::MissingTemplate inside Solid Queue; the page simply never updates.
# OPENBSD/data/debt.yml called this out as "several Turbo broadcasts use implicit
# to_partial_path with no matching partial" — there were more than several, and the
# reasons split into two very different groups.
#
# This test pins both:
#
#   1. Every implicit broadcast from a model whose table exists must have the
#      partial its to_partial_path resolves to. Two did not (Tv::StreamChat,
#      Tv::VideoNote) and are now explicit; three more (Reaction,
#      Playlist::TimestampedComment, SecurityAdvisory) broadcast into streams with no
#      subscriber and no container at all and were removed rather than wired.
#
#   2. The Shared::* social models used to broadcast implicitly. Post, Follow, and
#      ChatMessage were cut 2026-08-02 (no usable table in any schema, zero references).
#      The three that remained — Reaction, Notification, ReviewCase — kept implicit
#      broadcasts into shared:reactions/notifications/review_cases, streams with no
#      subscriber and no partial anywhere. Their tables DO exist (amber even creates
#      ReviewCase rows), so unlike the cut trio the callbacks could actually fire and
#      raise MissingTemplate in Solid Queue. Those three callbacks were removed 2026-08-02
#      — the same treatment the Tv/Playlist dead broadcasts got. There is now no implicit
#      Shared::* broadcast left to tolerate; the streams are guarded below with the other
#      removed ones, so re-adding a subscriber without a partial fails this test.
