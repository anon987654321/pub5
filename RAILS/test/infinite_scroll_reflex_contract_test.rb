# The 21 infinite-scroll reflexes share one spine: paginate a scope, render one
# partial per row, join. Only the scope differs. That spine now lives in
# Shared::InfiniteScrollReflex and each subclass declares two facts --
# `renders "<partial>", as: :<local>` and a private `scope`.
#
# Written before the unification, not after. There are no reflex tests at all,
# so a 21-file refactor had nothing watching it, and the two things that went
# wrong earlier today -- a deleted class whose subclasses my grep hid, and 164
# locale keys silently dropped -- were both "no check was looking" rather than
# hard problems. This is the check.
#
# Static: nothing here boots Rails. It reads the reflexes as text and asserts the
# declarations are present and point at partials that exist on disk, which is
# exactly what a typo in the refactor would break.
