  # A heading level skipped inside one view breaks the outline screen-reader
  # users navigate by. Six sites had it on 2026-08-10 -- five sidebars and a
  # comments section that all went h1 -> h3 -- and each was promoted with a
  # stylesheet rule holding the rendered size, so the outline changed and the
  # pixels did not (measured over CDP against the bundle at HEAD).
  #
  # This scans every view rather than pinning those six paths: the finding list
  # that named them had five, having missed a second h3 in posts/show.html.erb,
  # and a check that only knows the names it was given cannot catch the next one.
  #
  # Per-file, which is the honest limit -- a view rendered into a layout that
  # already carries an h1 is a skip this cannot see. It catches what it claims.
  # A heading is written three ways in this tree and only one of them is a tag.
  #
  # This scanned /<h([1-6])\b/ — literal markup only — while the dominant form
  # here is `tag.h1`, so the gate has been reading a fraction of the headings and
  # passing on what it could not see. posts/show, communities/index and
  # dating/home all head themselves with tag.h1 and were invisible to it.
  #
  # ERB comments are blanked first: a commented-out example beside a heading is
  # documentation, not markup, and counting it makes the fix for a finding read
  # as the finding.
