# github.com/anon987654321/pub4 is public and its history holds seven real 32-hex
# master.key blobs: DEPLOY/rails/{brgen,amber,bsdports,baibl,blognet,hjerterom}/
# config/master.key, added 2026-05-06 (ffb39dc12, b1882a484), moved 2026-05-17
# (28bad8208) and emptied 2026-05-29 (4f3780d89, 6f81a4d34) — plus MASTER/web's,
# untracked from the tip at 139c907e6. Emptying a file changes the tip, not the
# history: `git cat-file -p 28bad8208:DEPLOY/rails/brgen/config/master.key` returns
# 32 hex characters today. All seven are burned and cannot be un-burned.
#
# What made them dangerous was pairing: six sat beside the credentials.yml.enc they
# decrypt, and three of those .enc files were still tracked here on 2026-08-12 —
# MASTER/web, amber and bsdports. Verified by decrypting them with the historical
# keys: each held exactly one value, secret_key_base, and nothing else. No API key,
# no database password.
#
# They were removed rather than re-keyed, because nothing read them. Every
# Rails.application.credentials reference in this repo is inside a comment (the
# commented-out aws block in each app's storage.yml). Production takes the value
# from ENV — shared/config/environments/production_baseline.rb sets
# config.secret_key_base from ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"], /etc/<app>.env supplies it at
# 640 root:<app>, and each rc.d script hard-requires it
# (`: "${SECRET_KEY_BASE:?missing SECRET_KEY_BASE in /etc/<app>.env}"`), so the
# service refuses to boot without one. MASTER/web never needed a real value at all:
# its rc.d exports SECRET_KEY_BASE_DUMMY=1. A re-key would have produced a new
# secret for a file with no reader.
#
# The live values were confirmed to differ from the exposed ones before any of this
# was called safe — SHA256 of each, compared as digests rather than values: amber
# 9bbeac9f… in git against d14ba067… live, bsdports 6ffd8e80… against c50ceca2…
# So the rotation this debt asked for had already happened in /etc; what was left
# was the dead half still sitting in git.
#
# A tracked credentials.yml.enc is therefore a regression twice over: it is a file
# no code reads, and it re-creates the pair that made a burned key matter.
