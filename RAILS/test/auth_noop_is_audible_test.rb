# OPENBSD/data/debt.yml, brgen_allow_unauthenticated_access_is_a_noop: in an app
# whose User has a `guest` column, Shared::Authentication.allow_unauthenticated_access
# does nothing, and that is deliberate — guests get a soft Current.user so the
# product is usable without signup, and require_real_user is the identity gate.
#
# The part that was debt is that a control read as a control and returned in
# silence, so an author who wrote it got nothing and no warning. The fix is a
# dev/test log line. Nothing pinned it, which is how a fix of this shape is
# deleted by the next person tidying "unused" logging.
#
# Source-level on purpose: this is a class-method side effect at controller-class
# definition time, and RAILS/test/*.rb run under bare ruby with no app bundle.
