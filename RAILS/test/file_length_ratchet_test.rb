# rb_file_too_long / scss_file_too_long / view_too_long, as a ratchet rather than
# three lists — the same conclusion method_length_ratchet_test.rb reaches, for the
# same reason: a finding list is a snapshot and cannot hold a line while you work
# down it.
#
# Counted in code lines, non-blank and non-comment, matching lint:spine (which was
# re-expressed the same day), [DENSITY], and the method ratchet. Under the raw
# count these rules charged for documentation, and this tree's convention is a
# paragraph of rationale above the tricky line. Four of the recorded 24 findings
# were only ever over the limit on their comments: _brand.scss (441 raw / 379
# code), _chrome_polish.scss (405/366), amber's application layout (153/143) and
# gates/lib/live/page_simulation.rb (360/295).
#
# Generated files are excluded rather than exempted-in-place, because "split it"
# is not an available action for them: db/schema.rb is written by Rails from the
# migrations and hand-edits are overwritten on the next `db:migrate`. brgen's is
# 1,359 code lines and will never be anything else.

  # raise one, and never add a row without saying why here.
  #
  # Only the .scss and .erb numbers moved, and brgen's PWA manifest left the list
  # outright: it was never over the limit on code, only on the prose above it.
  # The .rb numbers are unchanged, which is the point of stripping per language —
  # a first pass that also treated `/*` as a Ruby comment reported four .rb files
  # as 100–290 lines shorter, all of it real code sitting between the `/*` and
  # the `*/` of a glob like `"**/*.rb"`.

  # remainder is 129 lines of methods. That is what "splitting is possible"
  # looked like when something finally forced it.

# infinite_scroll_wiring_test.rb — one subject, and the one most likely to
# keep growing, rather than eight more entries in a bundle of forty
# unrelated deploy contracts. ROOT and the two source readers went to
# test/support/source_reader.rb so both files answer "where is the tree"
# the same way; copying them would have made two answers that drift, which

# design_metrics/contrast_checks.rb. One subject, and the maths it calls
# was split off the same subject at the other layer in
# gates/support/design_metrics/contrast.rb.
#
# The move broke something first, in the way this repo keeps finding: the
# budget path was `File.expand_path("../../data/css_budget.yml", __dir__)`
# and one directory deeper that resolves to gates/lib/data, which does not
# exist. No exception — a rescue logged "rules unreadable" and ran the gate
# unbudgeted, so the contrast ceiling stopped being enforced while the gate
# still printed ok. Caught by diffing the gate's whole output before and
# after, which is now the standard for a split in this file.

# is colour rather than geometry, and the rendered counterpart to the
# source-side checks split out of design_metrics the same day.
#
# Verified by diffing the gate's whole output, and that diff is worth
# recording because it was not empty: subpixel and type_scale findings
# moved by a component or two. Running it a third time with no edit between
# moved them again, so those two checks are non-deterministic run to run
# and the delta was not the split. The 108 contrast and apca findings —
# the ones this file is actually responsible for — were byte-identical
# across all three runs.

    "gates/support/page_inventory.rb" => 440,

# `--- websocket framing ---` banner, above which every method speaks CDP
# (navigate, evaluate, press, screenshot) and below which every method
# speaks RFC 6455 and knows nothing about Chrome. The 101 lines below it
# are gates/support/cdp_framing.rb, included back in, so the methods stay
# private to CdpSession exactly as they were.
#
# Two constants had to move or be qualified: MAX_FRAME_BYTES went with its
# only reader, and Error/Desync are now CdpSession::. Constant lookup is
# lexical and an included module does not see the includer's constants —
# which surfaced as the frame reader raising NameError, reported by the
# runner as a gate that errored and blocked nothing. Verified by running
# viewport_spill and occlusion against live apps with GATE_STRICT_ERRORS=1;
# the desync-recovery path fires in that run, so the extracted code is
# exercised rather than merely loaded.
    # 436 -> 406 on 2026-08-26. The dependency graph and the wordmark are
    # _port_graph.scss. Still over the 400 limit and still on this list: most
    # of what is left cannot be moved, because bsdports styles `article >
    # header` and `.search-result` twice each in this one file, so the blocks
    # between those pairs are order dependent. The graph was the largest block
    # that shares no selector with anything left behind.
