# that source files contain particular class/def strings. They never boot Rails and
# never call a method, so they pass against a body of `raise` — OPENBSD/data/debt.yml
# calls them tautological and it is right. What they cannot express is the number
# that matters: how much of each app has a test at all.
#
# This is that number, as a ratchet. It cannot make anyone write a test, but it makes
# the count visible, stops it falling, and fails when it has risen and the floor was
# not raised with it — the same contract as MASTER's rake lint:spine and the
# chrome_i18n_lint baselines.
#
# Deliberately not a percentage: a percentage moves when someone deletes a
# controller, which is not coverage improving.

  # reason a host count falls. brgen 15->12 controllers / 11->10 models on
  # 2026-08-02 as the five verticals moved to engines/*: those counts were basename
  # collisions — flat host tests (channels_controller, home_controller, comment, …)
  # that also matched a same-named vertical class — so extraction removed a
  # double-count, not coverage. The host classes of those names are still tested and
  # still counted; the vertical classes are counted from engines/*/app now.
  # controllers 12 -> 11 on 2026-08-12: maps controllers moved to engines/maps.
  # Check-in is still asserted from host integration tests; the engine source
  # no longer basename-collides with a host maps_places test that was never there.

    # deleting a garment on a packing list all raised InvalidForeignKey, because
    # the schema had the constraint and the model declared no dependent option.

    # Playlist::Playlist and Playlist::ListeningParty. It was the only one of the
    # five verticals with no test directory at all, and the largest untested
    # surface in the tree — this ratchet already counted engines/*/app, so the
    # zero was visible here the whole time and nobody had raised it because a
    # floor of 11 does not complain about an engine sitting at nothing.
    # models 18 -> 19 on 2026-08-16. Not this branch: the test arrived with

    # ratchet exists to catch.

    # before any of them. models had been RED at 17 against this 19 since before
    # that day; CommunityWikiPage, CommunityWikiRevision, LinkPreview and
