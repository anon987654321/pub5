# Two rate limits on one controller are one rate limit unless they are named.
#
# ActionController::RateLimiting builds its counter key as
#
#     cache_key = ["rate-limit", scope, name, by].compact.join(":")
#
# with `scope` defaulting to controller_path and `name` to nil. So two
# `rate_limit` calls in one controller, both unnamed, address the same counter.
# Rails says so in the method's own docs — "If you want to use multiple rate
# limits per controller, you need to give each of them an explicit name via the
# `name:` option" — and four controllers here had not.
#
# It is not a subtle degradation. Each `rate_limit` registers its own
# before_action, so one request increments the shared counter once per limit,
# and `store.increment`'s expires_in only applies when the key is created. In
# MessagesController that meant: 30/minute and 40/3-minutes on :create, sharing
# a key for every signed-out sender, the counter going up by two per message,
# the 30 filter blocking after 15, and the 3-minute window never existing —
# whichever call created the key set a 1-minute TTL for both.
#
# The declaration looked exactly like a working two-tier limit. This is the
# repo's own dominant defect class (inert config, a reader that is not there),
# and it needed no code change to introduce: two correct-looking lines.
