    # domain we intend to run and have wired into OPERATOR.sh#ALL_DOMAINS, but
    # relayd only answers for an apex whose certificate exists on disk — see
    # RAILS/BLOCKERS.md "City vanity TLS". Linking the rest puts dead links in
    # front of every visitor, so nothing user-facing may iterate ENTRIES.
    #
    # Ground truth is `grep keypair /etc/relayd.conf` on vm23, and domain_alignment
    # now asserts this list equals (ENTRIES ∩ those keypairs) so it cannot drift
    # silently in either direction.
    #
    # Seven, as of 2026-08-12, up from two. The five that joined were not five new
    # certificates: acme-client had been issuing and renewing for stvanger.no,
    # trndheim.no, cardff.uk, edinbrgh.uk and frankfrt.de all along, and all five
    # resolved to 46.23.89.226. They were missing one `tls keypair` line each, so
    # they completed the TCP connection on 443 and then refused the handshake —
    # which to a visitor is worse than NXDOMAIN, because a browser reports it as a
    # security failure rather than a domain that does not exist.
    #
    # The rest of ENTRIES: 33 are NXDOMAIN at their registrar and need money, not
    # config. amstrdam.nl and dnver.us have left us — amstrdam.nl is on Cloudflare
    # and 301s to afvinklijst.nl, dnver.us has expired. denvr.us, wshingtondc.com
    # and foball.no are still registered to us at Domeneshop and delegated to
    # Domeneshop's parking nameservers rather than ns.brgen.no; those three come
    # back with a delegation change in the panel and no purchase.
    #
    # This is a separate constant rather than a seventh field on Entry because
    # domain_alignment parses these lines with a six-argument regex. A seventh
    # field makes that scan return nothing, and the gate then compares two empty
    # sets and passes having measured nothing.
