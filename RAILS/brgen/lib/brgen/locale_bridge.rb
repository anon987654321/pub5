module Brgen
  # Entry.locale is the language of the city. This decides what I18n.locale
  # becomes, which is a different question: it may only name a locale brgen
  # actually ships a translation for.
  #
  # Two locales ship — nb and en — so this maps to two.
  #
  # de.yml, fr.yml and nl.yml existed and held five keys each: hello, app.name,
  # feed.title, nav.sign_in, nav.new_post, against en.yml's 1579. Eleven city
  # domains routed to them, so those pages rendered five translated words and
  # 1574 English ones — which reads worse than a page that is in English,
  # because a reader cannot tell whether the rest is missing or the product is.
  #
  # Two were served the wrong language outright. mlan.it and lisbon.pt resolved
  # to :fr under a rule that mapped Italian and Portuguese to "the nearest
  # available Romance locale"; French chrome on an Italian city is not nearer
  # than English. That is the same mistake the Polish note below records, and it
  # survived the fix because the rule was narrowed rather than dropped.
  #
  # The stubs are deleted rather than kept unrouted: a locale file nothing loads
  # is the inert-config shape this tree keeps finding. Filling them is a
  # translation budget and a product decision — RAILS/TODO.md carries it — and
  # until then these cities get one language, consistently.

    # rather than as a gap. It never fired — RAILS/test/locale_contract_test.rb
    # asserts en and nb declare the same keys, and they do, all 1579 of them.
    # A fallback reachable only by breaking a contract test, and wrong when it
    # is reached, is not a safety net.
