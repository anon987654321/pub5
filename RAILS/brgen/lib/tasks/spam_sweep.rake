# Bot spam that reached the live feed, and the reason it was invisible.
#
# Found 2026-08-12 while measuring title repetition per city: Cardiff's most
# common post title was "Hello there," six times over. All 16 of cardff.uk's
# posts were spam, and cardff.uk had gone live that afternoon.
#
# 41 posts across nine cities, dated 2026-07-17 to 2026-08-06. Two families:
#
#   SEO/proxy pitches   "Hello http://takeaway.cardff.uk," / "I would like to
#                       discuss AI SEO!" / "Greetings from DreamProxies"
#   price templates     the same "I wanted to know your price" sentence in
#                       Latvian, Vietnamese, Welsh, Armenian, Georgian, Albanian
#                       and Latin — one bot, one phrasebook
#
# The subdomains in those titles are the tell. dating.cardff.uk, maps.cardff.uk,
# marketplace.cardff.uk and playlist.cardff.uk were never linked anywhere: the
# bots enumerated them from Certificate Transparency, which publishes every SAN
# on every certificate we issue. Any host we get a certificate for is public
# knowledge within minutes, whether or not it is announced.
#
# Soft delete, not destroy. `removed_at` is what ModerationWorkflow sets, and
# Post.kept — which hot, fresh and top all chain from, and the sitemap with them
# — filters on it. So one column takes a post out of the feed, the post page,
# search, hashtags and the sitemap at once, and leaves it readable for anyone
# checking whether the sweep was right.

  # Deliberately narrow. Every pattern here was checked against all 1447 posts on
  # production and matched 41, with no false positives — the seeded Norwegian
  # content contains no URLs, no CRLF and no "Hello <something>," titles.
  #
  # CRLF earns its place: a person typing in the compose box sends \n, while
  # every one of these arrived with \r\n, which is what a script posting a
  # canned message does. On its own it would be too clever to trust; alongside
  # the others it is corroboration.

  # The pattern list caught 41 and missed 16, because it was a list of languages
  # and the bot has more languages than I do: the same "I wanted to know your
  # price" sentence turned up in Hungarian, Galician, Basque, Azerbaijani, Irish,
  # Igbo, Hawaiian, Greek and Italian after the first sweep, along with two
  # keyboard-mash posts and two <p>test</p> posts.
  #
  # Authorship is the signal that does not need a phrasebook. Every one of the 57
  # spam posts on this site was written by a guest_*@guest.local account, and
  # every legitimate post — including the ten short Live posts where title and
  # body are identical by design, which is what broke the obvious content-shaped
  # rule — was written by a named account. 57 of 57 and 0 false positives.
  #
  # That is a fact about today, not a policy. Anonymous posting is a feature
  # here, and the moment a real person uses it this rule starts throwing away
  # their post. It is a sweep for a backlog, not a spam filter; the filter is
  # still missing, and the note below the sweep says so.
