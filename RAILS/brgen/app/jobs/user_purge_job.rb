# GDPR Art. 17 erasure, on a delay. schedule_deletion! sets deleted_at now and
# deletion_scheduled_at +30 days (a grace window). This job runs after the
# window and erases the account's personal data.
#
# The users row is anonymised in place rather than destroyed, so that replies
# and threads keep their shape and no foreign key breaks. That decision has a
# consequence worth stating plainly, because it was not stated and the erasure
# was wrong for it: **no `dependent: :destroy` in the graph ever fires on this
# path**. Nothing is destroyed, so nothing cascades. Every table holding
# personal data has to be named here or it is kept.
#
# It was only the users row and its sessions. A purged account still had its
# dating profile — bio, coordinates, profile photographs and the
# identity-verification selfie — plus its delivery addresses, its postal
# addresses with recipient and phone, its federated email and phone number, its
# newsletter subscription, and the coordinates attached to every post and story
# it had written. Some of those are the most sensitive rows in the tree.
#
# Three dispositions, and which one a table gets is a legal question rather
# than a technical one:
#
#   destroy  — the row exists only to describe the person. A dating profile is
#              not shared content; removing it collapses no thread. Attachments
#              go with it, which is how the photographs and the selfie leave.
#   nullify  — the row must be retained but some columns are personal. A
#              takeaway order is a financial record the restaurant may be
#              required to keep (Art. 17(3)(b)); the address it was delivered
#              to is not part of that obligation.
#   keep     — nothing personal, or retention is required outright. Named in
#              the contract test with a reason, so the next person adding a
#              table has to make the same decision rather than inherit silence.
