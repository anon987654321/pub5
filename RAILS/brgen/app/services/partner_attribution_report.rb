# frozen_string_literal: true

# Clicks we sent, conversions that came back, and the gap between them.
#
# Before outbound clicks were counted there was no way to read a network
# dashboard: "nobody clicked" and "tracking is broken" both report zero
# conversions, and nothing in the tree knew which. This is the line that tells
# them apart, and it is the reason the click table exists.
#
# The join is `epi`, not the merchant name. Shared::OutboundClick records the
# merchant we linked to; Shared::AffiliateConversion records a program_id and the epi
# TradeDoubler echoed back. Only the epi appears on both sides, which is what epi
# is for.
#
# Three numbers matter more than the totals:
#
#   unattributed_conversions — a conversion whose epi matches no click we recorded.
#     Traffic is converting through a path we are not measuring (an old link, a
#     cached page, or the Link Converter rewriting an anchor the beacon missed).
#   silent_merchants — clicks with no conversion at all over the window. Normal for
#     small numbers; suspicious for a merchant with real traffic.
#   clicks_without_epi — links that went out with no epi, so any conversion they
#     produce lands in unattributed_conversions. This is the number to drive to zero.
