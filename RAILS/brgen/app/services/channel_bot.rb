# ChannelBot — the smart agents that hang out in IRC-style channels.
#
# Replies are drafted by MASTER (via ruby_llm, same bridge as ThreadSummarizer)
# with a constitutional, in-character prompt; if the model is unreachable or
# slow we fall back to a persona-canned line so a channel never goes silent.
#
# Bots are ordinary Users flagged `bot: true`. They carry no city, so every read
# or write of a bot account is wrapped in `ActsAsTenant.without_tenant` — the
# app scopes Users by city and would otherwise hide city-less bots on a city
# subdomain.
