# Something happening in the city, at a time, that people can say they are
# coming to.
#
# Location is deliberately two-sided: an event either points at a Place (a venue
# already on the map, with its own coordinates) or carries a free-text
# venue_name plus its own lat/lng. Requiring a Place would mean no one could
# post a party in their own flat, and requiring coordinates would mean no one
# could post one before the venue was settled.
