  # a down-vote moves the score by -2, and saved_change_to_value gives both ends
  # of that without another query.

  # `votable.user` was a lazy belongs_to read on a votable the controller loaded
  # by id, and ApplicationRecord is strict_loading by default — so this raised
  # after the vote had already been written. It was invisible for as long as
  # VotesController#find_votable 404'd before ever reaching a save (post_vote_path
  # carries a slug, and find_votable called find). Fixing the 404 exposed it.
  #
  # votable is polymorphic, so Shared::StrictSafeAssociations#strict_safe does
  # not apply — it needs reflection.klass, which a polymorphic belongs_to has no
  # single answer for. Reading the author id off the table avoids instantiating
  # either record.
