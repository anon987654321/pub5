# and the spine renders one partial per record.

# Scope copied from ConversationsController#index, INBOX_ORDER included: pins
# first, then newest message via a correlated subquery. Ordering in Ruby after
# the fact pins nothing on page two, because the page is chosen before the sort,
# and a reflex that ordered differently from the controller would append rows
# that do not follow from the ones above them.
