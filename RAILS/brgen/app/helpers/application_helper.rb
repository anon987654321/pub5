  # wore it too — markedsplass and dating were indistinguishable from the city
  # apex they hang off. One mark still, not seven: the city label keeps the
  # weight and the wordmark's letterspacing, and the subdomain and TLD are set
  # quieter around it, so the shape a reader recognises is unchanged and the
  # thing it now says is true.
  #
  # Current.domain is the city domain the request resolved to (brgen.no,
  # lsangeles.com), so this follows the registry rather than parsing the host a
  # second time and disagreeing with it.
  # The mark is the brand, and only the brand.

  # It used to render the whole host on a vertical -- quiet "markedsplass.",
  # bold "brgen", quiet ".no" -- so that one wordmark could say which surface
  # a reader was on. That prints a URL where a logo goes, and it is a thing the
  # nav already says better: the swiper marks the active vertical, and the page
  # itself is the answer. Operator decision 2026-08-27.
  #
  # A single-length mark also retires the gutter arithmetic it needed. The

  # eleven other destinations. On dating it was a dead end: dating renders no
  # primary nav at all (operator, 2026-08-25), so the wordmark is the only
  # chrome on the page and it did not lead anywhere.
