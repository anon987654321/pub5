  # :restrict_with_error, not :destroy -- an order is a financial record and a
  # buyer's receipt, and the seller who withdraws a listing does not own the
  # buyer's half of it. Operator decision 2026-08-09.
  #
  # The listings controller withdraws rather than destroys (status: "removed",
  # which ListingPolicy::Scope filters out of every index and show? hides from
  # non-owners), so this does not fire on the normal path. What it guards is the
  # cascade: User has_many :marketplace_listings, dependent: :destroy, so
  # destroying a seller previously destroyed every order placed against them,
  # including the buyers' side.
  #
  # That cascade is now refused, which leaves an open question rather than a
  # closed door: account deletion has no controller path today, and when one is
  # built it has to reconcile the buyer's right to a receipt with the seller's
  # right to erasure. Anonymising the seller and keeping the order is the usual
  # answer; that is a product decision, not this file's.
