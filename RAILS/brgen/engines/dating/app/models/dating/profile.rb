  # reshuffled, so a profile you had just seen could not be found again.
  #
  # Three ingredients, in this order:
  #
  #   recency  — who is actually around. A dating app whose deck is full of
  #              dormant accounts is a dating app nobody matches on.
  #   effort   — a profile with prompts answered gives the viewer something to
  #              reply to, which is the whole interaction this vertical is for.
  #   shuffle  — a per-viewer, per-day deterministic jitter. Without it the same
  #              profile is top of everyone's deck forever, and with plain
  #              RANDOM() the order changes on every reload.
  #
  # Deliberately not "attractiveness", engagement or any like-count feedback
  # loop: ranking people by how much attention they already get is how these
  # products end up with a handful of accounts receiving everything.
