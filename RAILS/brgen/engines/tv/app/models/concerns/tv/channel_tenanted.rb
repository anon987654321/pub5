  # For tv records that have no city of their own and inherit one from their
  # channel: Tv::Video and Tv::Broadcast.
  #
  # This is the fix for the tv.oshlo.no 500 of 2026-08-12. Tv::Channel includes
  # CityTenantable, so acts_as_tenant puts a default_scope on it. Tv::Video does
  # not, and tv_videos has no city_id — a video's city is whatever its channel's
  # is. On brgen.no the two agreed and nothing showed. On oshlo.no:
  #
  #   Tv::Video.trending.includes(:channel)
  #
  # returned Bergen's six videos, because nothing scoped the videos — and then
  # the preload of :channel ran through Channel's default_scope, matched no rows
  # for Oslo, and set every video's channel association to nil. The card partial
  # says tv_video.channel.name, so the page 500'd. belongs_to :channel is
  # required and the FK was set on every row; the nil came entirely from the
  # tenant scope, which is why it looked impossible.
  #
  # Guarding the view against a nil channel would have stopped the 500 and left
  # the real defect: one city's videos listed on another city's front page. The
  # scope is the fix; the crash was the symptom that made it visible.
  module ChannelTenanted

    # The nil-city_id decision documented here is now TenantedThrough's, shared
    # with Marketplace::Deal, which had the same defect through :listing and no
    # scope at all: acts_as_tenant :city is `optional: true`, so a parent with
    # no city is legal and reads as global rather than orphaned — it should
    # appear in every city, not in none. No such rows exist today (all three
    # production channels are Bergen's); this decides the case before it
    # arrives rather than after.
