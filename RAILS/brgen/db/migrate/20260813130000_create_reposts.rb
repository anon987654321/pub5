# The repost button has been on every feed card since the design landed, with
# no route, model, controller or column behind it. For a while it also carried
# data-controller="action" with no URL, so pressing it added the active class,
# sent nothing, and told the user their repost had landed until the next render
# took it back.
#
# (shared/_action_bar.html.erb carries a second copy of the button, but no view
# in any of the three apps renders that partial — see RAILS/TODO.md 1.1.)
