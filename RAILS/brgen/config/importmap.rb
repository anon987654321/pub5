# The verticals' controllers, pinned by absolute engine root.
#
# pin_all_from resolves a relative path against Rails.root, so the line above
# covers brgen/app/javascript/controllers and nothing else. Each engine pushes
# its own app/javascript onto config.assets.paths, which makes the file
# *servable* — but importmap needs a *pin* for the module specifier to exist,
# and eagerLoadControllersFrom("controllers") only walks what the importmap
# declares. So every vertical's Stimulus controller was reachable over HTTP and
# registered nowhere.
#
# Measured on the booted app before this: 92 pins, 20 under controllers/, not
# one of them from an engine. Dead in production as a result: the playlist audio
# player (playlist/playlists/_player), the TV video player on all three watch
# pages, and dating's intro/discover toggle on its landing page.
