# ApplicationRecord sets strict_loading_by_default, and test/production both
# raise. A `dependent: :destroy` cascade has to load its dependents in order to
# delete them, and there is no preload that avoids that — so strict loading on
# such an association can only ever produce a crash, never catch an N+1 worth
# catching. Every controller `destroy` action finds its record by id, with
# nothing preloaded, which is exactly the shape that breaks.
#
# Found via Takeaway::Review (Shared::Reactable's reactions). There are 121 such
# associations across the three apps; these cover app-owned ones, and
# test_every_cascading_association_opts_out_of_strict_loading covers the rest
# by reflection.

  # This case used to create an order and a review and assert the whole lot was
  # destroyed. `Marketplace::Listing#orders` is now
  # `dependent: :restrict_with_error` (operator decision 2026-08-09): an order is
  # the buyer's receipt, and the seller withdrawing a listing does not own the
  # buyer's half of it.
  #
  # Rewriting it surfaced a consequence worth stating rather than discovering
  # later. `Marketplace::Review` validates that the reviewer has an accepted or
  # completed order against the listing, so **a listing with any review
  # necessarily has an order, and can therefore never be hard-destroyed.** The
  # reviews cascade is not dead — it still fires for a listing that collected
  # favourites, deals or reviews-less traffic and never transacted, which is what
  # this case now covers — but it is unreachable for anything that ever sold.
  # That is the intended shape: a listing that has taken money is withdrawn, not
  # deleted.
