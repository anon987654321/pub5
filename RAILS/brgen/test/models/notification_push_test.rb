# Shared::Notifiable dropped `kind` on its title/body branch, so every
# transactional notification — an order advancing, a saved search matching, a
# listing about to lapse — was written as the column default "custom", which is
# not in PUSHABLE_KINDS. And Notification#title/#body were methods shadowing the
# real columns, so the stored title rendered as "New notification" with an empty
# body in the list, the row partial and the push payload.
