# CommunityBan carries banned_by, reason and expires_at, so every fact about a
# ban lived on the row — and Communities::BansController#destroy deletes it. The
# existing "any moderator can lift any ban" test asserts the row count drops by
# one, which is exactly the behaviour that used to erase the evidence. These
# assert the record survives it.
