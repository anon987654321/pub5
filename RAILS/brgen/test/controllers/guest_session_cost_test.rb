# What a visitor with no session cookie costs.
#
# This file used to open "Every request without a session cookie creates a guest
# user", and that was the problem as much as the description. Assigning the
# throwaway password through has_secure_password's setter hashed it at
# BCrypt::Engine.cost — 12 in production, 1,025 ms on vm23's single core — so
# crawlers, uptime probes, robots.txt and manifest.json each burned a second of
# CPU minting an account that can never sign in. Measured 2026-08-01 across
# 275,334 logged requests: 38.9% sat in one 900-1100 ms bucket against 18-24 ms
# for the same endpoint once a cookie existed, and the table had accumulated
# 102,778 guest rows.
#
# That pass fixed the cost per row and left the rows. By 2026-08-14 there were
# 206,497 of them — 10,461 a day, of which one day's 10,463 had ZERO sessions
# between them and ONE authored post.
#
# So the first sighting no longer writes anything. It gets an unsaved ::User,
# which answers every read a view or policy makes, and a marker goes in the
# session. A browser that keeps cookies returns it and gets a row; a crawler
# that discards them never comes back and never costs one. Both halves are
# pinned below: what a row costs, and when a row is written at all.
class GuestSessionCostTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest

  # Deferring the row must not cost a first-time visitor the thing they did:
  # someone arrives, acts immediately, and the action has to land on a user with
  # a primary key.
  #
  # Two mechanisms hold that up, and this asserts the outcome rather than either
  # one. ensure_guest_user! runs as a before_action for every non-GET, and
  # ActiveRecord independently saves an unsaved belongs_to target before saving
  # the owner, so `votes.find_or_initialize_by(user: Current.user)` persists the
  # guest on its own. Deleting the before_action and re-running the suite leaves
  # this test green and fails exactly one other — RepostsControllerTest, which
  # reads an id before it writes. That is what the before_action is for, and
  # checking rather than assuming is the only reason this comment is accurate.
