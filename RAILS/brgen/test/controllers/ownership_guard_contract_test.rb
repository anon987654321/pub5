# Five separate controllers shipped `update`/`destroy` actions with no
# ownership check, independently, before this session's audit caught them
# (posts, delivery_drivers, tv/{channels,live_streams,videos},
# listening_parties). That's the same bug five times, not five unrelated
# bugs — this test turns "add an ownership check" from a convention someone
# has to remember into something CI actually verifies for every controller
# with a mutating action, present and future.
#
# A controller passes if it has ANY recognizable guard: a before_action
# naming an authorize/owner/host/admin method, an inline Pundit `authorize`
# call, an inline `Current.user == ...` / `...== Current.user` /
# `.owner?(Current.user)` check, or a finder that's already scoped to
# Current.user (e.g. `Current.user.posts.find(...)`) so no separate check
# is needed. Controllers with no ownership concept at all (session-only,
# token-authorized) are named explicitly below with a one-line reason —
# silence is not an allowlist entry.
