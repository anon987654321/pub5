class PostsControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  # Post includes CityTenantable -> acts_as_tenant :city. A request to brgen.no
  # sets ActsAsTenant.current_tenant (application_controller.rb:66-69), which
  # scopes every Post query to that city_id. A fixture built out here, with no
  # request in flight, has no tenant and gets city_id: nil — invisible to the
  # scoped query, so the controller 404s.
  #
  # That only bites where a City row for the host actually exists, and the two
  # environments disagreed about exactly that. Measured: the local test database
  # holds 0 cities, so City.find_by(domain: "brgen.no") is nil, the tenant is
  # never set, the query is unscoped and the fixture is found. The VPS seeds 44
  # cities before running the suite, so there the tenant is real. Same code, same
  # commit, opposite results — and the failing side was the one nobody watches.
  #
  # So this creates the city rather than looking it up. Finding it would leave
  # the local run on the untenanted path forever, which is the path that cannot
  # catch this: a test that only exercises the bug on a machine you do not watch
  # is the blind spot, not the fix.
