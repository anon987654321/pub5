# TradeDoubler answers in more than one shape, and every method in
# tradedoubler_parsing.rb exists because a feed came back in one the previous
# version did not handle. None of it was pinned: the file had no test, so the
# only thing between a feed changing shape and the sidebar silently going empty
# was somebody noticing.
#
# Written when the parsing half was split out of tradedoubler.rb. The split was
# proved by diffing its output against the pre-split file over these payloads;
# this keeps that comparison, so the next shape change has something to fail
# against.
#
# It lives in brgen's suite rather than RAILS/test because the parsing depends
# on ActiveSupport (`presence`, `truncate`) — the first draft of this file ran
# under bare ruby on the assumption that it did not, and that assumption is what
# the errors corrected.

#
# `dig` takes alternative KEYS, not a path — dig.call("availability",

# availability: { inStock: false } hands in_stock? a Hash. `.to_s.downcase` on
# it matches none of the out-of-stock strings and the fallback then finds no
# top-level inStock either, so the row reads as stocked.
#
# Whether TradeDoubler ever sends that shape is unmeasured — the nested
# payload above is constructed, not captured — so this records the behaviour
# instead of changing it. If a real feed turns up with a nested availability,
# this test is where the evidence goes and in_stock? is what changes.
