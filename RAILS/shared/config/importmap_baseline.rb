# Vendored, not CDN. The dist build is what makes that possible: src/index.js
# pulls in ./fetch_request, ./fetch_response, ./request_interceptor and ./verbs
# via *extensionless* relative imports — valid for a bundler, which auto-resolves
# the .js, but not for a browser's native ES module loader, which requests the
# literal path and 404s. dist/requestjs.js is pre-bundled with no imports at all.

# The cable_ready gem ships its own importmap pinning morphdom to ga.jspm.io,
# with `pin`'s default preload: true — measured on live brgen.no, that host and
# jsDelivr were the two external modulepreloads on every page. This line runs
# after the gem paths are drawn, so re-pinning the same name overrides it.

# No futurism pin, because nothing consumes it: no ERB in any app carries
# data-controller="futurism". `pin` defaults to preload: true, so pinning it
# costs an eager fetch on every page load to register a controller nobody asks
# for. The `futurism` gem stays in all three Gemfiles for the server-side
# `futurize` helper; wiring a real paginated index to it is the open lazy-render
# work in FINAL_TODO P0.4, and that starts by putting this pin back.
# No date-fns pin, and unpkg.com is no longer contacted by any app. It existed
# for one consumer, @stimulus-components/timeago, and that controller is gone:
# it reads data-timeago-datetime-value, no view in any app ever set one, and its
# only possible effect was to overwrite the server's localised Norwegian with
# date-fns English. Relative time is now rendered server-side by
# Shared::UiHelper#time_ago. Restoring the pin means restoring the CDN, because
# date-fns's ESM build cross-references ~200 siblings by *relative* path
# (./addDays.js, ./formatDistance.js, ...) — vendoring one flattened file breaks
# every one of those paths once served from our own domain.
#
# preload: false on every CDN-backed pin from here down. `pin` defaults to
# preload: true, so each emitted a <link rel="modulepreload"> on every page of
# every app -- jsDelivr and esm.sh on the first-paint critical path whether or
# not any code on the page imported them. stimulus_boot.js registers carousel on
# demand; without this the preload fetched it anyway and the deferral bought
# nothing.

# Tiptap, vendored rather than fetched — the rule this tree states in
# STIMULUS_COMPONENTS_BASELINE.md and enforces for @stimulus-components. It was
# two esm.sh pins, so every compose box on the site depended on a third party
# being reachable at the moment someone started writing.
#
# preload: false is load-bearing. `pin` defaults to preload: true, which emits a
# modulepreload and fetches all 288KB on every page load — for an editor most
# visits never open — and makes the controller's dynamic import() decorative.
