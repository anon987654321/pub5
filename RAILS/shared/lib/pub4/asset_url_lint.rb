  # The other half of css_coverage_lint: a stylesheet asking for a *file* that is
  # not there.
  #
  # css_coverage_lint measures class names in both directions and never looks
  # inside a declaration, so nothing in this tree read `url()`. The audit that
  # produced it checked `image_tag` and `asset_path` — helper calls, which fail
  # loudly — and skipped the one reference form that fails silently. Propshaft
  # warns at precompile for some of them and not others, and the warning it does
  # print is unactionable noise (`shared/public/fonts` is served by the engine's
  # static middleware, not digested by the pipeline, so those files are present
  # and warned about anyway). A warning that is wrong most of the time trains
  # people to skip the one time it is right.
  #
  # Measured 2026-08-12: three of brgen's `pp-neue-montreal` weights 404 in
  # production, and had since the file was written. `font-display: optional`
  # means the page never blocks and no pixel visibly changes, which is why five
  # months of deploys and an asset audit did not surface it.
  #
  #   missing_asset — a url() whose file exists in none of the roots that serve
  #     the stylesheet. Counted, not fixed: whether the answer is to add the file
  #     or drop the reference depends on why it is missing, and for the three
  #     PP Neue Montreal weights the SCSS already answers it (licensed font,
  #     files deliberately absent, `local()` + fallback carries the surface).

    # Measured 2026-08-12: 9 reported → 5 recorded, after fixing the one that was
    # a live bug.
    #
    # 9 → 5 was the work. amber's layout links `/lightgallery.css`, amber has no
    # copy of its own, so it was served `shared/public/lightgallery.css` — whose
    # icon font and spinner live at `../fonts/lg.*` and `../images/loading.gif`,
    # present in `brgen/public` and in no root amber can see. Verified against
    # production before and after: `amber.brgen.no/fonts/lg.woff2` was 404 while
    # the stylesheet asking for it was 200, so every lightbox control in amber
    # rendered as a missing glyph. Four files copied into `shared/public`, which
    # the engine's static middleware serves to all three apps.
    #
    # The 5 that remain are both deliberate:
    #
    # 3 are pp-neue-montreal-latin-{400,600,700}-normal.woff2, documented in
    # brgen/app/assets/stylesheets/_fonts_brand.scss as a licensed face whose
    # woff2 cannot be committed; the `src:` list starts with two `local()` entries
    # and the marketplace surface names an Arial fallback, so the design already
    # assumes the fetch fails. Recorded rather than removed: dropping the url()
    # would silently break the documented plan of dropping the files in.
    #
    # 2 are lg.svg, lightGallery's IE9 fallback, once per vendored copy. It sits
    # last in a `src:` list behind woff2/woff/ttf, so no browser that exists asks
    # for it, and adding a file nothing requests is worse than recording it. The
    # two copies are themselves the register's `rails_duplicate_vendor_css`.
