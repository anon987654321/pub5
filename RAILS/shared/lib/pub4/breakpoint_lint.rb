  # Ratchet: every media-query width must be one of design_tokens.yml's `viewport`
  # edges, or that edge minus 1px for a max-width bound.
  #
  # Colour, space, motion, elevation and the dialect maps are all single-sourced;
  # breakpoints were the one axis that was not, and they drifted the way an
  # unmeasured axis always does — 13 distinct widths across 58 queries, including
  # three spellings of one edge.
  #
  # Two kinds, because they are not the same defect:
  #
  #   unknown_edge   — a width that is not in the token list at all. Cosmetic drift
  #                    until two of them disagree about the same edge.
  #   ambiguous_edge — one number used as BOTH a max bound and a min bound
  #                    somewhere in the tree. At exactly that width both blocks
  #                    match, so which one wins is source order rather than intent.
  #
  # The second kind is deliberately a property of the tree and not of the line. A
  # first version flagged every `max-width` equal to a token edge and reported 14,
  # which is not a defect: `(max-width: 768px)` with `(min-width: 769px)` is a
  # correct scheme, and so is `(max-width: 767px)` with `(min-width: 768px)`. This
  # tree uses both. The bug is only ever the collision.
  #
  # Same contract as empty_state_lint and chrome_i18n_lint: baseline per kind,
  # never raised to silence a new finding. Opt out one line with
  # `// breakpoint: ok` on it or the line above.

    #
    # ambiguous_edge was 26 sites over three numbers — 640, 768 and 1265 were each
    # both a floor and a ceiling somewhere in the family, so at exactly those three
    # widths two blocks matched and bundle order decided. Closed by moving the six
    # colliding max-bounds down one pixel, which keeps the interpretation the
    # min-width author had already declared. It is a ratchet at zero now, not a
    # tolerance: the next collision is a new one.
    #
    # unknown_edge is 0 as of 2026-08-15, down from 3. The three that were "design
    # decisions rather than typos" — 700px in brgen/_marketplace_nav_bar, 400px and
    # 600px in shared/_zen_shell — are gone from the sheets, so the tolerance that
    # existed for them is gone too. The next unrecognised width is a new one.
    #
    # A fourth, 769px in brgen/_root, was a genuine gap and is fixed: the compose
    # control's tablet band started one pixel above the edge the rest of the family
    # uses, so at exactly 768px it fell through to base styling while the shell
    # around it was already in its tablet band.
    # unknown_edge 0 -> 1 on 2026-08-16, and the raise is a correction rather
    # than a tolerance for something new.
    #
    # The note above said all three were gone from the sheets. Two of them never
    # were findings: `@container grid (min-width: 400px)` and `(min-width: 600px)`
    # in shared/_zen_shell are container queries, and a container query measures
    # the element's own container rather than the viewport, so neither number
    # means anything on this scale. QUERY matched them because the eight
    # characters are identical in both at-rules. See CONTAINER below.
    #
    # The third is real and is still there: `(max-width: 700px)` in
    # brgen/_marketplace_nav_bar:256, the band where the marketplace search takes
    # its own row. The family's tablet edge is 768, max-bound 767, so viewports
    # between 701 and 767 get the wide marketplace nav while every other surface
    # already treats them as a tablet. Moving it to 767 closes that and changes
    # what renders at those widths, which is an operator's decision and not a
    # lint's.
