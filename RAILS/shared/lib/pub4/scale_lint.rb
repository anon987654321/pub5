  # Ratchet: every spacing, line-height, radius and weight literal in the family's
  # stylesheets must land on a declared step.
  #
  # This is the axis BreakpointLint's header lists as already single-sourced and
  # is not. Colour is single-sourced, motion is single-sourced, elevation is
  # single-sourced, viewport is single-sourced since breakpoint_lint. Rhythm was
  # never measured, and it drifted the way an unmeasured axis always does:
  # 539 spacing literals over 93 distinct values, and 13 distinct line-heights
  # for what is one body-text rhythm (1.5, 1.55, 1.45, 1.4, 1.3, 1.25, 1.2, 1.15,
  # 1.6, 1.7 …), measured 2026-08-15.
  #
  # The nearest prior art is the stylelint ecosystem — `stylelint-scales`
  # (numeric scales per property, with autofix to the nearest allowed step),
  # `rhythmguard` (token-or-scale enforcement for spacing/radius/type), and
  # `stylelint-a11y`'s line-height-is-vertical-rhythmed. None of them run here:
  # this tree has no Node in its check path and its lints are Ruby over source.
  # So the rule families are reimplemented, not the tools.
  #
  # Five kinds, because they fail differently:
  #
  #   off_scale_space       a padding/margin/gap step nothing else in the family
  #                         uses. Two of these next to each other read as a
  #                         mistake even when neither is wrong alone.
  #   off_scale_line_height a body rhythm invented at the call site. This is the
  #                         one that shows as "the page looks unsettled": a
  #                         paragraph at 1.45 beside one at 1.55 is a half-pixel
  #                         of drift per line that accumulates down the column.
  #   absolute_line_height  `line-height: 28px`. It does not inherit — any child
  #                         at another font-size gets 28px anyway, which is the
  #                         defect stylelint-a11y's rule exists for, and it is
  #                         worse here because brgen's root is 18px.
  #   off_scale_radius      a corner nothing else in the family has.
  #   off_scale_font_weight a weight the loaded faces may not even have, which
  #                         the browser then synthesises.
  #
  # Same contract as breakpoint_lint and chrome_i18n_lint: a baseline per kind,
  # never raised to silence a new finding. Opt out one line with `// scale: ok`
  # on it or the line above.
