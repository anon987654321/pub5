module Pub4
  # Run-queue length, on the operating system this actually deploys to.
  #
  # This exists because `File.read("/proc/loadavg")` was the load guard on
  # PruneGuestUsersJob, and OpenBSD has no /proc. The read raised ENOENT, a
  # bare `rescue StandardError` returned false, and the guard reported "not
  # busy" on every tick — inert on the only machine it was written to protect,
  # and written the day after that job took the whole site down.
  #
  # So the contract here is that unknown is not zero. `.one` returns nil when
  # the load cannot be read, and every caller has to decide what nil means for
  # it, out loud. A guard that cannot see is a different thing from a guard
  # that sees an idle box, and collapsing the two is what made the last one
  # useless.

    # down the unknown path on every developer machine. Pulling the numbers out
    # rather than positioning against them covers both.
