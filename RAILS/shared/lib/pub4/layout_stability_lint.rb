  # Ratchet: nothing on a page may change size after it has been painted.
  #
  # This is the other half of "well proportioned". ScaleLint asks whether the
  # numbers come from one scale; this asks whether the layout those numbers
  # describe holds still while the page loads. They are different defects and
  # only the second one is visible to a user -- a card that is 0px tall until its
  # photo arrives and then 240px tall shoves everything below it down, and the
  # reader loses their place. Google names the measurement Cumulative Layout
  # Shift; the causes are a short list and every one of them is legible in
  # source.
  #
  # Three kinds:
  #
  #   unreserved_media   an <img>/image_tag with neither width+height attributes
  #                      nor a class whose CSS reserves the box (aspect-ratio,
  #                      an explicit height, or contain-intrinsic-size). This is
  #                      the overwhelming majority of real CLS.
  #   layout_transition  a `transition` naming width/height/top/margin/`all`.
  #                      Those animate on the layout thread: every frame is a
  #                      reflow of everything after the element, which is the
  #                      difference between a smooth open and a stuttering one.
  #                      transform and opacity are the compositor-only pair.
  #   font_without_display  an @font-face with no font-display. The default is
  #                      `auto`, which most browsers render as `block`: text is
  #                      invisible for up to three seconds and then arrives at a
  #                      different width than the fallback it replaced.
  #
  # Deliberately source-level. A headless-browser CLS measurement is the more
  # direct instrument and this tree already has one path for that
  # (RAILS/gates/rendered_gates), but browser gates belong on the deploy host --
  # they monopolise a machine for an hour. This runs in milliseconds on every
  # check and catches the cause rather than the symptom.
