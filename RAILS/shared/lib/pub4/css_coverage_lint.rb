  # CSS drift, in both directions.
  #
  # The register has carried `rails_unused_css_selectors` (102 selectors with no
  # markup) since the 2026-08-10 audit, and admitted in its own entry that no
  # committed tool reproduces the number. The opposite direction — a class an ERB
  # template asks for that no stylesheet defines — was never measured at all, and it
  # is the more interesting half: an unused selector is dead weight, while an
  # undefined class is a hook the author expected to do something. Both are the same
  # defect this repo keeps finding, a declaration with no reader, pointing opposite
  # ways.
  #
  # Measured 2026-08-11 against the compiled bundles as well as the sources, because
  # the bundle is what production serves: none of the reported classes has a rule in
  # brgen's, amber's or bsdports' application.css.
  #
  #   undefined_class — used in markup, defined nowhere. Either a missing style or
  #     dead markup; which one is a design decision, so this counts rather than fixes.
  #   unused_selector — defined, and no markup names it. Ratcheted with a wide
  #     tolerance on purpose: class names are also composed at runtime
  #     (`"card card--#{kind}"`), so a literal search cannot prove death, which is
  #     exactly the caveat the register entry records.

    # Measured 2026-08-11: undefined_class 128 reported → 96 real → 4 remaining.
    #
    # 128 → 96 was the instrument getting honest. It read only .scss/.css and so
    # reported every mail-* class and every legal-* class as undefined; both were wrong.
    # Email cannot load an asset bundle, so the mailer layout defines its classes in an
    # inline <style>, and brgen's _site_legal_footer carries a <style> block that styles
    # the three legal pages. Inline blocks are read now.
    #
    # 96 → 4 was the work: 63 classes were styled in the *_coverage_fills.scss files and
    # the engines' own stylesheets, token-only, and the rest were classified rather than
    # invented for — a class that always shares its element with a styled sibling
    # inherits from it, and a class that names the Stimulus controller mounted on the
    # same element is that controller's identity.
    #
    # The 4 that remain are single-word legacy names — .inline, .post, .text, .list —
    # each on one surface, each doing nothing. They are markup to delete rather than
    # styles to write, and deleting a class that short wants a human who can grep for it
    # in a template language a regex reads badly.
    #
    # unused_selector 266, recorded rather than chased, per the register's own caveat
    # that a literal search cannot prove a runtime-composed class name is dead.
    # 4 → 35 on 2026-08-16, and this raise is a report rather than a tolerance.
    #
    # The four legacy single-word names above are still four. The other 31 are
    # two whole features that have views and no stylesheet at all:
    #
    #   events   9 classes — event-card, event-card-media, event-card-body,
    #            event-list, event-list--past, event-detail, event-hero,
    #            attendee-list, rsvp-form, rsvp-bar
    #   stories  7 classes — story-rings, story-ring-name, story-ring-count,
    #            story-ring-nav, story-viewer, story-viewer-head, story-media,
    #            story-caption, viewer-list
    #
    # There is no _events.scss and no _stories.scss in brgen, and `event-card`
    # and `story-ring` appear in no stylesheet in the tree. Those pages render
    # with no styling whatsoever — not mis-styled, unstyled.
    #
    # The rest are smaller clusters of the same kind: communities moderation
    # (ban-list, mod-queue, member-list, community-rules), plus feed-action-form,
    # post-quotes and viewer-list.
    #
    # Deliberately not written here. Inventing a visual design for eleven
    # components is not a lint's decision and not a passing agent's; the numbers
    # and the cluster names are what makes it someone's.
    # unused 279: the typography foundation adds opt-in measure classes (prose,
    # reading-column, form-measure, ...) worn by tokens, not yet by every view.
    #
    # undefined 0: _coverage_fills.scss gives Event, Story and the moderation
    # pages a box model. The fill is structural and token-only -- flex, gap,
    # var(--space-*), var(--surface-elevated), var(--radius-*), no colour and no
    # hex -- so an unstyled page gets geometry without anyone deciding what it
    # looks like. Past that the design is still someone's, and this is a floor
    # rather than a licence to style from a lint.
    # Comes down with the code, never up to meet it: this ratchet fails on slack
    # as well as on excess.
    #
    #   278 -> 276  the Live surface went, orphaning the inline compose block in
    #               _nav.scss whose last caller it was
    #   276 -> 275  the presentational class `dim` went from markup and
    #               stylesheets alike, with the seven naming hooks that had been
    #               riding on its styling
    #   243 -> 240  three selectors regained markup in the parallel visual
    #               sessions; the ceiling follows the tree down.
    #   275 -> 243  the instrument learned to read a class attribute that embeds
    #               an ERB conditional — class="unit<%= " unit--wide" if wide %>"
    #               never matched the plain pattern, so the base name and the
    #               literal inside the tag both read as dead. swiper-wrapper
    #               joined its library's other runtime classes in EXTERNAL, and
    #               the two wardrobe-slide fills whose carousel markup had gone
    #               were deleted.
    #
    # undefined back to 0 (2026-08-21): the seven hooks the instrument fix
    # surfaced are designed now — unread/read and message--unread wear weight
    # plus a leading accent dot, story-ring wears the accent ring that fades
    # when seen, and the default address is the accent-bordered card.
    # 240 -> 174 on 2026-08-22: 40 proven-dead rules deleted (the .animate-*
    # utility set the flat contract orphaned, the pre-unification
    # .brand-wordmark, the city-home intro, legacy card/search shells), and
    # the DYNAMIC_SEEDS above stopped the census miscounting runtime-built
    # names. The 174 left are dominated by amber sheets, which belong to
    # amber\x27s active session — recorded in SURFACES.md, not touched here.
    # unused_selector RAISED 174 -> 180 on 2026-08-25, and the six are named
# because a raised baseline without a list is a number nobody can act on.
#
# Nine unrendered partials were deleted and took their markup with them, so
# the CSS only they used went unreferenced: jox-logo and logo and frames from
# _jox_logo, marketplace-subnav from _subnav, feed-tab and type from
# _city_switcher. The two dedicated stylesheets went with their partials —
# shared/_device_showcase.scss whole, and its two @forwards — but these six
# live inside _root.scss, _nav.scss, _marketplace.scss and
# _jsfiddle_chrome.scss alongside rules that are still used.
#
# Left for the owner deliberately: visual work in this tree is not something
# to do on a tool's judgement, and dead CSS costs bytes where dead markup
# cost a reader's time.
# unused_selector 180 -> 153 and undefined_class 0 -> 9 in one change, both from
# teaching used_names about classList. The JS was already in the scanned set and
# every pattern looked for a `class=` attribute, which is the one way a Stimulus
# controller never applies a class.
#
# The 28 that stopped being reported were rules styling a state only JS produces —
# real CSS, called dead by a detector that could not see its trigger.
#
# The 9 that appeared are the opposite and are named here because this file's own
# rule is that a raised baseline without a list is a number nobody can act on:
#   canvas-inverted  lazy-fade-in  lazy-loaded  luxury-product-ready
#   queued  show  start-ack  tap-ripple  ui-inverted
# Eight of the nine have no rule in any stylesheet and are never read back by
# `classList.contains` or a selector, so applying them does nothing at all —
# neither paint nor state another reader can see. That is a finding per site, not
# a sweep: a missing rule and a leftover toggle look identical from here, and
# deleting the call is wrong if the CSS was lost rather than never written.
# undefined_class 9 -> 4 and unused_selector 153 -> 156, both 2026-08-27, when
# brgen lost its left rail, its right rail and the city-today strip.
#
# The fall is the real half: five classes that markup named and no stylesheet
# defined left with the markup that named them.
#
# The rise is honest debt. Removing that much markup orphans selectors, and I
# removed the ones I could attribute -- the whole .city-today block,
# .sidebar-dropdown, .sidebar-dropdown-menu and .sidebar-card__head. Three more
# are unattributed: the shared .sidebar, .widgets and .widget-search rules all
# stayed live because amber still renders them, so the remainder is not there.
# Recorded rather than chased, and recorded rather than hidden.
