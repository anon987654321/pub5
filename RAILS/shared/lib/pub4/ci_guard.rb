    # shell scripts at /var/db/pub4/ci.lock. Two files, no mutual exclusion
    # between them — and the half that was actually being locked was the half
    # left in world-writable /var/tmp, which is precisely what that rewrite was
    # written to fix. It moved the callers that were not locking anything.

    # An override is honoured only when its directory is not world-writable.
    # That is the property the /var/tmp objection was about: a fixed name in a
    # directory anyone can write to is a symlink an attacker plants and root
    # then chmods. Checking the directory lets a test point this at a private
    # tmpdir without reopening the hole, which hardcoding one path would not.
