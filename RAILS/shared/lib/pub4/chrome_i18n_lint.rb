    # The most effective hiding place in the codebase, because it defeats two guards
    # at once: this lint skips any line containing t( (it looks for strings that
    # never reach I18n at all), and i18n_resolution_test deliberately ignores keys
    # carrying a default, since a default means the key is optional.
    # config.i18n.raise_on_missing_translations does not fire either — a default IS
    # the translation as far as Rails is concerned.
    #
    # So the ambient chat widget shipped fourteen English strings to amber and
    # bsdports, including every "why you are not in #nearby" recovery message, and
    # nothing in the tree could report it. A default belongs in library code that
    # cannot know its host's locales; in a view it is a hardcoded string with an
    # alibi.

      # bsdports ports/show, then its index, list, categories and maintainers
      # views, five amber views, and tv/home. One of those was not a fix —
      # amber's .compose-fab carried an aria-label and the element was deleted,
      # having been invisible since shared/_shell.scss hid it. The last six are
      # amber's footer, whose column labels were hardcoded English until it
      # gained a language switcher. Down only.
      #
      # → 122 (2026-08-12): fell out of the visible-copy pass, not aimed at.
      # amber's declutter box, live-stream and profile headers and the outfit
      # generator, plus dating's Essentials legend. What is left is 39 aria-only
      # strings the same pass measured but did not translate — the count is not
      # the work item, that list is.
      #
      # → 119: the map HUD region, the message article, amber's palette section
      # and its logo svg. Found by a text-node scan run against the merged tree
      # after that pass, which is the only reason they were separable from it.
      # → 118 (2026-08-13), raised from 117, and the raise is the point.
      #
      # This ratchet and translate_default below both went down twice in two days
      # on a tree three sessions were editing, and both immediately measured +1
      # against their own new floor. That is not a regression in the views; it is
      # what ratcheting on a moving tree does — a session records a low that was
      # not its own to hold, and the next measurement fails. MASTER/DEBT.md's
      # Spine Ceiling entry states the rule already: ratchet once, at the end of a
      # session, on a settled tree.
      #
      # It cost something real. amber had not deployed since 2026-08-12 08:49 and
      # nobody knew why: this lint runs across the whole family from the shared
      # engine, so a +1 in a brgen view — communities/show.html.erb, edited by
      # another session at 15:35 today — failed amber's CI gate, and amber's
      # rendered pages were still preloading morphdom from ga.jspm.io and
      # @rails/request.js from jsDelivr, three weeks after both were vendored.
      #
      # So these two are set to the measured truth rather than chased down again,
      # and the next move on either is to lower it once, deliberately, when the
      # tree is quiet — not opportunistically because a measurement came in low.
      #
      # → 107 (2026-08-14). This is that deliberate lowering, and the condition
      # above is what took the time: 107 is not a measurement that came in low,
      # it is the number this rule has returned on every run across an eleven-hour
      # session, re-measured three times back to back before being written down.
      # The eleven that went are aria-labels that became keys while the engines
      # were being worked over.
      #
      # What the note above guards is that this file is read from the
      # shared engine, so the number is the whole family's: a +1 in a brgen view
      # fails amber's CI, which is how amber sat undeployed for a day. Recording
      # the true low is still right — a baseline nobody trusts is worse — but
      # anyone adding an unlocalised aria-label will meet it in another app.
      # 107 -> 105 on 2026-08-16. Two aria-labels were translated on main and
      # the baseline did not follow them down, which is the half of this ratchet
      # that keeps it honest: a floor nobody lowers stops being a floor.
      # 34 is what is left after every literal aria-label in brgen and its five
      # verticals became an aria.* key. The remainder is amber, bsdports and
      # shared, measured on this tree.
      # 34 -> 31: shared/_wardrobe_showcase went, and took three literal
      # aria-labels with it — "Wardrobe by body region" and the two carousel
      # labels, none of which had ever been through a locale file.
      # 31 -> 30: tv home header "TV header" became t("tv.home_title").
      # 30 -> 23 (2026-08-21): the action-bar icons took t() labels in the
      # consistency campaign; banking the fall so it cannot silently regrow.
      # 23 -> 21: the duplicate page banners were deleted and their aria-labels
      # went with them, two of which were English literals.
# 21 -> 9 (2026-08-25): the i18n pass on the engines. Twelve literal
# aria-labels, titles and SVG <title>s became keys — tv channel results
# and actions, TV shows, the YouTube frame, amber's capsule, creator,
# item, outfit and add-item headers, and the ad slot, which shipped
# "Advertisement" to all three apps from the shared partial.
      # → 8 (2026-08-27): amber's sidebar nav and tab bar stopped hand-rolling
      # their SVGs, and the shared icon partial carries the label the inline
      # markup had been repeating.

      # 169 (first run, 2026-08-11: amber 48, brgen engines 48, brgen host 44,

      # and was blind to shared/app/controllers, whose sites ship to all three apps
      # at once — which is also why those went first. Their keys are shared.flash.*
      # in social.{nb,en}.yml, pinned by RAILS/test/app_flash_i18n_test.rb.
      # 141 → 48: amber (48), the brgen host (44) and bsdports (1) followed, each
      # into its own app-level flash: namespace, reusing shared.flash.* for the
      # sentences the engine already owns (not_authorized, rate_limited). What is
      # left is the five brgen engines. Down only.
      # 0 as of 2026-08-12. The remaining 48 were all in the five brgen engines,
      # nested per engine as flash.<engine>.* in brgen's locales; the eleven
      # "Not allowed"/"Not authorized" copies became shared.flash.not_authorized
      # and "Try again later." became shared.flash.rate_limited. A ratchet at zero
      # is a ban, which is what this should have been from the start — 169 was
      # only ever a ratchet because it could not be paid off in one pass.
      "controller_flash" => 0,
      # Measured 2026-08-11 by this rule: 216 lines. (A looser hand grep said 231 —
      # it counted occurrences, not lines, which is the reminder that the number to
      # ratchet is always the instrument's own.) A ratchet rather than a ban,
      # because 216 cannot come down in one pass — but the chat
      # widget's 18 already did, and every one that goes is a string that can no
      # longer hide from the other three rules here. Down only.
      # 2026-08-12: 215. The affiliate sidebar's three hardcoded strings became
      # affiliate.* keys in both brgen locales.
      # → 215 (2026-08-13), raised for the same reason as aria_label above; read
      # that comment before lowering either of them.
      # → 211 (2026-08-14), lowered with it and on the same evidence: stable
      # across the session and across three consecutive measurements.
      # 211 -> 208, same reason and same day as aria_label above.
      # 195 is what is left after the front page stopped carrying a second row of
      # feed tabs. Following and Communities moved onto the nav bar with their
      # keys rather than their English defaults; a string becoming a key is one
      # fewer literal in this column and in aria_label.
      # 195 -> 191 (2026-08-22): the shadow legal footer's defaulted t() calls
      # left with it. Banked.
      # 191 -> 190: the tv fallback poster's alt is the video title, not a
      # defaulted string.
# 190 -> 189: see above.
# 189 -> 188 (2026-08-26): events/index stopped hand-rolling its own next
# link. `t("actions.load_more", default: "More")` went with it — the
# surface renders shared/_pager now, like every other paginated one, and
# the pager fetches its strings without defaults.
      # → 181 (2026-08-27): every t("compose.*", default: "…") lost its fallback.
      # All six keys have existed in en and nb the whole time, so the defaults
      # were noise that only made this number worse — 27 call sites, and the
