  # The importmap contract, shared because the importmap is shared: all three

  # the critical path does it to all three at once. One copy of the assertions,
  # three one-line test files.

  # It has to boot Rails rather than read importmap_baseline.rb as text, and
  # that is the whole reason it exists. Two external hosts were preloaded on
  # every brgen.no page and we pinned only one: cable_ready ships its own
  # config/importmap.rb pinning morphdom to ga.jspm.io, gem paths are drawn
  # before the app's, and `pin` defaults to preload: true. Nothing in this repo
  # named the host. A source scan cannot see a dependency's pins; the resolved
  # importmap has it in one line.

            these pins put a third-party host in <link rel="modulepreload"> on every page:

              #{external.map { |name, url| "#{name} -> #{url}" }.join("\n  ")}

            `pin` defaults to preload: true, so the browser fetches these before
            first paint whether or not anything imports them. Either vendor the
            module into shared/vendor/javascript, or pin it preload: false and
            import it lazily. If the pin comes from a gem rather than from
            importmap_baseline.rb, re-pinning the same name after the gem paths
            are drawn overrides it.

            these pins resolve to a third-party host and are not on the allowlist:

              #{unexpected.map { |name, url| "#{name} -> #{url}" }.join("\n  ")}

            Lazy or not, each is a runtime dependency on someone else's uptime
            and a record of every visitor's IP handed to them. Vendor it, or add
            it to Pub4::ImportmapPreloadAudit::ALLOWED_EXTERNAL_PINS along with
            the reason it is acceptable.
