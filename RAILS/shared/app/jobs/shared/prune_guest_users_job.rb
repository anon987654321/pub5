  # Delete guest rows nobody is behind any more.
  #
  # Two things were wrong with the one-liner this replaces, and both were silent.
  #
  # `in_batches(of: 500, &:destroy_all)` batches by primary key, and the relation
  # carries a LEFT OUTER JOIN from `where.missing(:sessions)`. Run against
  # production on 2026-08-13 it removed 3,832 of 143,339 eligible rows and
  # returned success: batching by id over a joined relation while deleting from
  # that same relation does not survive the deletion. Plucking ids and deleting
  # by id does, and re-querying each pass means the scope is always current.
  #
  # And every destroy raised FOREIGN KEY constraint failed, from SQLite rather
  # than from Rails, because `User` declared no association for message_receipts
  # or typing_indicators — both of which carry an FK to users. Guests owned
  # 194,295 receipts. That is fixed in User::CoreAssociations; it is named here
  # because this job is where it surfaced, and the same gap made account deletion
  # impossible for any real user with chat history.
  #
  # The pacing is not tidiness either. vm23 is one vCPU, a guest destroy cascades
  # into message_receipts, and resource_guard sheds amber and bsdports under load.
  # Running this unpaced against production took relayd down with it — the whole
  # site, not one app. So it yields between batches and stops entirely when the
  # box is already busy, on the assumption that a hygiene job is never worth an
  # outage and can always finish tomorrow night.

    # Public channels do not save a guest from collection; private threads do.

    # makes a participant row and a receipt for each message in it. Exempting
    # participation as such would have exempted nearly the whole population and
    # quietly turned this job into a no-op on the one box it exists to protect.
    #
    # A thread someone opened with you is the other case. Collecting that guest
    # cascades through conversation_participants and leaves the other side
    # holding a room that has lost half its history — and it outranks the
    # retention arithmetic besides: a message invite is signed for thirty days
    # and a session-less guest goes after seven, so an anonymous host could hand
    # out a link, be collected, and leave it resolving to nothing for three more
    # weeks. Conversation.channels is the roster and every entry in it has a
    # slug, so slug-lessness is what separates a conversation from a room.

    # Skipped rather than slowed when the box is loaded: a queue worker competing
    # with a deploy or a CI run is how the shed starts.
    #
    # Read through Pub4::LoadAverage, which asks sysctl and returns nil rather
    # than zero when it cannot tell. /proc/loadavg does not exist on OpenBSD:
    # reading it there raises ENOENT, and a bare rescue around that answers
    # "not busy" on every tick of the only machine this guard exists for.
    #
    # Unknown counts as busy. A hygiene job that skips a night costs nothing; a
    # hygiene job that runs blind against a 1-vCPU box cost the site once
    # already. The log line is there so a permanently-blind guard shows up as
    # a job that never removes anything, rather than as silence.
    #
    # The FIVE-minute average, not the one-minute, and that is the whole
    # difference between this guard working and not. Measured on vm23
    # 2026-08-14: the wrapper waited until the 1-minute load was 1.85, started
    # the runner, and booting Rails drove the 1-minute average to 3.31 — over
    # the 3.0 ceiling — so the job's first check saw the spike it had itself
    # just caused and quit having removed nothing. On one vCPU a Rails boot
    # alone clears 3, so a guard reading the 1-minute average can never let this
    # job start.
    #
    # The 5-minute average was 1.77 at that same moment: it describes the box
    # rather than the last thing to touch it. A prune that genuinely loads the
    # machine still raises it, just over minutes instead of instantly, which is
    # the behaviour wanted from a brake. Pub4::CiGuard gates on the same field.
