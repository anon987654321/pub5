# One read path over every affiliate network, so a new network is an adapter
# plus a line in NETWORKS rather than an edit to every view that shows a deal.
#
# Before this, `shared/_affiliate_deals` called Tradedoubler directly. That made
# TradeDoubler both "the network we happen to use" and "the way deals are read",
# so Amazon Associates could not appear on the surface at all without editing
# the view — and any second network would have had to be threaded through by
# hand everywhere.
#
# The table is the source of truth. Views read AffiliateProduct, which every
# importer writes into on its own schedule; a live call only happens as a
# last resort when the table has nothing, and even then it is cached. That
# ordering matters: an outbound HTTP call inside a page render turns an
# advertiser's outage into our latency.
