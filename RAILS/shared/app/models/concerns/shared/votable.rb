    # Every one of these used to issue SQL unconditionally. `votes.sum(:value)`,
    # `.where(...).count` and `.find_by` all go to the database even when the
    # association is already in memory — unlike `.size` or an Enumerable
    # traversal, which use the loaded records. So a feed that carefully
    # preloaded :votes still ran two aggregate queries per post: 100 of the home
    # page's 243 queries came from here and from Post#comment_count.
    #
    # strict_loading did not catch it because nothing was lazily *loaded* — an
    # aggregate on an association is a fresh query, not an association load.
    # A table carrying its own score column is the authority; Vote maintains it
    # on write. Posts have one because `hot` and `top` order by it and an
    # aggregate cannot be indexed. Comments and Takeaway::Review do not, because
    # nothing ranks them — they read a score one record at a time, where the sum
    # is a single cheap query and a counter would be a second thing to keep true.
