    # The actor is nearly always a belongs_to (`actor: :user`, `:buyer`,
    # `:sender`, …). Reading it with a bare public_send inside an after_commit is
    # a lazy association read, and strict_loading_by_default is true in every
    # environment with production raising rather than logging. So emitting an
    # activity event for any record that was loaded from the database — which is
    # every controller update action — raised *after* the write had committed.
    #
    # record_activity! already swallows its own failures ("activity skipped"),
    # but the old actor lookup happened *outside* that rescue, so it propagated
    # and turned a successful save into a 500. 38 models pass `actor:`, and every
    # one with an `updated:` event was affected (Tv::Video, Tv::Channel,
    # Marketplace::Deal, Marketplace::Store, Takeaway::MenuItem,
    # Takeaway::Restaurant, Dating::Profile, …).
    #
    # Analytics must never be the reason a write fails, so this degrades to a nil
    # actor instead of raising — matching record_activity!'s existing contract.
