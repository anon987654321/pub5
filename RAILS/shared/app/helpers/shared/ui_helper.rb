    # marketplace, dating, tv, playlist and takeaway — so on those surfaces the
    # shared widget fell through to its "no chat on this app" branch and offered
    # a link to another domain, on the same application, with the same
    # Conversation model and the same room that works on the front page. maps
    # and messenger are not engines, which is exactly why only those two worked.

    # brgen surface, and still return nil on amber/bsdports, which genuinely
    # have no Conversation model and should keep the handoff.

    # page settles, and it also made the chat tab's own width unstable: measured
    # 2026-08-08, four identical loads gave chat/92px, brgen/102px, brgen/102px,
    # chat/92px depending on whether the frame had landed. layout_snapshot had
    # been drifting on that pair for many runs and re-baselining never converged,
    # because it was re-recording whichever side of the race it caught.

    # the geo room when the visitor has coordinates and the city lobby otherwise,
    # from exactly the values available here. Returning nil on an app with no
