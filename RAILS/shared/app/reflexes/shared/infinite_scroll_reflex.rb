module Shared
  # The spine every infinite-scroll reflex shares: paginate a scope, render one
  # partial per row, append, and tell the sentinel where it got to.
  #
  # Twenty-one subclasses across the three apps each carried their own copy of
  # the first two steps -- an identical `load_more` that paginated and called
  # super, and a `page_html` that differed only in a partial path and a local
  # name. The scope is the only thing that was ever different, so that is
  # the only thing a subclass writes now, alongside one `renders` line.
  #
  # A reflex that needs more than the pattern has three seams rather than a copy
  # of the spine: `after_paginate` for work between pagination and rendering,
  # `row_locals` for a partial that takes more than the record, and `after_row`
  # for markup interleaved between rows.
  #
  # `after_row` exists because the home feed had no seam that fit and overrode
  # `page_html` instead — the one method the contract test names as re-implementing
  # the spine. It needed to interleave an affiliate unit every Nth row, which
  # neither of the other two seams can express, so the copy was the only way to
  # say it. A seam here says it once for all twenty-one subclasses.
