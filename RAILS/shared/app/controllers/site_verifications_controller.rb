# Proof of site ownership for networks that ask for it.
#
# Written because Tradedoubler denied brgen.no on 2026-08-01 for "need of
# proof/confirmation of site ownership" and this app had no way to offer any:
# no .well-known, no verification file, no meta tag.
#
# A static file in public/ cannot do this job here. brgen serves roughly twenty
# city domains from one app, and every network issues a token per domain, so a
# file at public/tdverify.html would answer with the same token on oshlo.no as
# on brgen.no -- which is worse than no proof, because it is proof of the wrong
# thing. Brgen::DomainRegistry already resolves host to city, so the token is
# looked up per host.
#
# Tokens come from the environment, never the repo. A verification token is a
# shared secret with the network; committing one lets anyone who can read this
# tree claim the domain.
#
#   SITE_VERIFICATION="brgen.no:tradedoubler=abc123,google=xyz789;oshlo.no:tradedoubler=def456"
#
# Networks ask for the token in one of three shapes and this serves all three,
# because which one is wanted is their choice and not ours:
#
#   GET /.well-known/<network>-site-verification   -> the bare token
#   GET /<network><token>.html                     -> an HTML page containing it
#   <meta name="<network>-site-verification" ...>  -> rendered into the layout
