// Which onboarding prompt is allowed to speak, and when.
//
// Three prompts compete for a first-time visitor's attention and none of them
// knew the others existed:
//
//   install-prompt   "Install this app"            shared/_install_prompt
//   menu coach       "Menyen er nederst"           scroll_chrome_controller
//   push enable      "Slå på varsler"              push_controller
//
// The coach fired on a timer on the first page view and the push button
// appeared as soon as permission was `default`, so a visitor who had not yet
// read a single post could meet two interruptions before the product had shown
// them anything — while the install prompt, the one worth taking, waits
// (correctly) for real product value and so arrived last or not at all.
//
// The order is deliberate and not a matter of timing luck:
//
//   1. Install always outranks the other two. It is the only prompt that
//      improves every later visit, and it is the only one that becomes
//      impossible to offer once the visitor leaves.
//   2. The other two are worth nothing to someone still deciding whether they
//      care. They wait until the app is familiar, and they wait behind install.
//
// Familiarity is counted in sessions rather than page views. A visitor who
// opens six pages in one sitting has not become more used to the app six times
// over; they have visited once. A gap of SESSION_GAP_MS ends a session.
