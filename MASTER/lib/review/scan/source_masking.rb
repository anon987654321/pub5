    # the lookahead reports a missing label on a labelled control. Every
    # FORM_LABEL hit that survived the ERB fix was this shape.
    #
    # Each multi-line tag is rewritten onto its opening line and its newlines
    # moved after it, so the tag is matchable in one piece, the finding still
    # reports the line the tag opens on, and every later line keeps its number.
    # Quote-aware, because `>` is legal inside an attribute value and this repo
    # has it: `data-action="input->playlist#setVolume"` and an embed field whose

    # that `>` and loses every attribute after it.
