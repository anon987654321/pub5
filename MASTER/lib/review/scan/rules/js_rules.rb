      # A substitution is only safe if it preserves the rendered value. The tokens
      # whose values match the commonest literals — --bg, --surface, --border,
      # --search-bg — are theme-responsive: _dialect_tokens.scss defines them
      # inside @mixin brgen-old-dark-tokens and @mixin brgen-old-light-tokens, and
      # brgen includes both, under different selectors. So `--bg` is #000000 in
      # dark and #ffffff in light *within one app*. A literal is theme-independent
      # by construction; swapping it for the token makes it follow the theme,
      # which changes the other theme. That is a behaviour change wearing the
      # clothes of a lint fix.
      #
      # Scoping per app does not rescue it: brgen defines four single-valued
      # tokens of its own and no remaining literal equals any of them.
      #
      # So the question each finding actually asks is not "which token is this" —
      # it is "should this colour follow the theme or not", which only the person
      # who chose it can answer. Six passes over this rule removed 596 findings
