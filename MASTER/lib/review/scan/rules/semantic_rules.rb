          Red-team review of %<path>s.

          Step 1 — Steelman (internal, do not output): write the three strongest
          arguments that this code is correct and should not be changed.

          Step 2 — Answer each question silently; only include findings below
          if they survive the steelman:
            1. What is wrong with this design that I have not spotted?
            2. What would an attacker do with this code?
            3. What assumption is this built on that could be false?
            4. What breaks at scale or under failure?
            5. Is this wired to anything? Could it be deleted without loss?
            6. Is there a simpler approach that was not taken?
            7. What should be relocated or transformed to a different format?

          Step 3 — Output only surviving violations.
          Format: ISSUE:LINE:description (one per line).
          If nothing survives, respond with exactly: CLEAN

          Focus on: broken contracts, hidden coupling, axiom violations (CQS,
          ONE_JOB, GUARD_EXPENSIVE, FAIL_VISIBLY), security, and logic errors.
          Ignore style. Do not hallucinate method names.
