      # Every write judged by every mechanical rule, on both write paths, with no
      # command to remember. Only what a write *introduces* can block it: a file
      # carrying debt has to stay editable, or the first repair of it is refused.
      #
      # Semantic rules are excluded deliberately. They are 126 of the 225 and
      # cost one LLM call per file, which a per-write gate would pay twice — the
      # before and the after. They belong to the per-turn pass, not here.
      #
      # The mechanical half costs 1.2 ms on a 5-line file and 286 ms on a
      # 538-line one, both scans included. A new file pays for one.
