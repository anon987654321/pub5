      # How this repo counts code. One implementation, because there were three.
      #
      # `rake lint:spine` and `tools/ratchets.rb` each carried their own copy of
      # the non-blank-non-comment line count — for the same ratchet, reported in
      # the same table. `SmallFunctionsRule` carried a third for method bodies.
      # They happened to agree; nothing made them.
      #
      # Counting is also where a throwaway script is most likely to be quietly
      # wrong. A hand-rolled method-length counter that treats `def x = expr`
      # as running to the next `end` reports a tightly-factored file as sprawling,
      # and the number looks plausible enough to reason from. tools/fixtures/
      # declares the right answers for cases like that and `rake lint:instruments`
      # holds this module to them.
