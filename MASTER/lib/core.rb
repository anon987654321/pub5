# MASTER — a constitutional coding agent.
#
# The whole thing is one sentence: fold proposed effects through a constitution
# that admits each one before it touches the world. Four concepts carry it —
# Fold, Constitution (the gate), World (the effects), Memory (the record) — and
# this file holds the vocabulary they share.
#
# Until 2026-08-12 this was `core/master.rb`, the root of a second spine loaded
# on its own path. It is now `lib/core.rb`, autoloaded by the same Zeitwerk
# loader as the rest of `lib/`, which is what the path-to-constant mapping
# already wanted: `lib/core.rb` → `Master::Core`, `lib/core/fold.rb` →
# `Master::Core::Fold`. The fold still depends on nothing in `lib/` outside its
# own namespace — `test/core/test_no_lib_backedges.rb` is what holds that, and
# it is the part of the two-spine split that was carrying real weight.
module Master::Core
  # An Effect is something the agent wants to do. Nothing reaches the world
  # except by proposing an Effect and having the Constitution admit it. The verb
  # set is closed and small; that closure is what makes the agent auditable.

  # shapes; the third is internal to a single rule:
  #   Allow(effect:)       perform this effect (possibly rewritten by a rule)
  #   Block(reason:, by:)  it must not happen; the agent observes and adapts
  # A rule may also return Revise to rewrite the effect for the rules after it.
