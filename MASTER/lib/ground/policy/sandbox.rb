        # ordering straight through as "ask" instead of "deny" -- same
        # command, different flag order, real gap. DANGEROUS_RM_TARGET below
        # replaces the single-regex approach with actual flag parsing so
        # order/form can't matter. Also added: a classic fork bomb, wget
        # (curl's pipe-to-shell pattern only covered curl), and truncating a
        # raw block device via redirection -- none of those had any pattern
        # at all. The (?<q>["']?)...\k<q> wrapper was added after the
        # permanent test corpus caught `rm -rf "$HOME"` (quoted, still
        # expands under bash) slipping through as "ask" -- the bare pattern
        # only matched an unquoted target.
