      QUICKSTART = <<~TEXT.strip
        MASTER mental model: propose, validate against the constitution, execute with evidence, learn.
        Reconnaissance-then-edit: read full targets before patching. Standing orders lint written paths and audit lib/ for drift.
        Natural language works: "check my edits", "fix this file", "run through master". Golden rule: PRESERVE_THEN_IMPROVE_NEVER_BREAK.
        Smoke: bin/probe. Full readiness: bin/probe all. Deploy integrity: bin/probe integrity. Ferrum crawl: bin/probe crawl-browser (MASTER_CRAWL_BROWSER=1 on macOS).
        VPS: ruby34, bundle34 under /home/dev/pub4/MASTER. After web/ edits: doas rcctl restart master.
      TEXT

      AGENTS = <<~TEXT.strip
        Bootstrap for coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Aider). Authority: data/soul.yml → data/rules.yml → this runtime.
        Modules: cli (pipeline/CLI), fix (fix/rule/watch), review (scanner/council), voice (render/TTS), ground (constitution/memory), io (tools), trace (events/session), core (the fold).
        Flat Hierarchy: standing order aggressive_merge on every write — merge thin siblings, rename to dense Rails-parameterize slugs (snake_case, Strunk-clean tokens), OpenBSD-flat, Zeitwerk-true, Roda-tight.
        Pipeline (slash commands and inferred commands): #{Master::CLI::RuntimeMode::PIPELINE_STAGES}. Plain-language goals go to Core::Fold instead, which is the only lane the constitution judges. Every write on either lane is judged by Review::Scan::WriteGuard. Work is one pass: scan → fix → critique.
        VPS/deploy: OPENBSD/RUNBOOK.md (human runbook). Say the path — through runs the sequence.
      TEXT

      TRACE = <<~TEXT.strip
        Trace map: Trace::EventBus carries pipeline, tools, scans. CLI: /tail 20 pipeline. Web: /events/stream.
        Activity: runtime/events/activity.jsonl (/tail, /replay). Evidence: runtime/events/evidence.jsonl (/replay evidence).
        Session: .master/session.json (/history). Undo: .master/undo_journal.jsonl (/undo).
        Triage: /status, /tail, /dmesg, bin/probe. Key events: pipeline:stage_start, review:verdict, scan:progress, route:resolved.
      TEXT

      REPLICATE = <<~TEXT.strip
        Only replicate_kokoro TTS uses the Replicate API. Token: REPLICATE_API_TOKEN in /etc/master.env or ~/.config/repligen/config.json.
      TEXT

      CONVENTIONS = <<~TEXT.strip
        Inviolable law: data/soul.yml, data/rules.yml. Evidence mandatory — no hedges without command output or diffs.
        Ruby 3.3+ on OpenBSD. Style: frozen_string_literal, double quotes, no bare rescue, guard clauses, Result monad, files ≤300 lines, methods ≤10 lines.
        Shell on zsh/SSH: no sed/awk/grep/find — Ruby and zsh builtins. Scan before structural edits.
        VPS: dev@46.23.89.226, ruby34, bundle34. Operator: OPENBSD/RUNBOOK.md. Full rule index: data/CANON.md (generated).
