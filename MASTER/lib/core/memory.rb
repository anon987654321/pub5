  # Memory — the record. Holds the conversation the model sees, compacted to a
  # budget. Compaction is turn-aware: it summarises the oldest turns and keeps
  # the recent ones whole, never orphaning an observation from the effect that
  # produced it.
  #
  # This is where the old trace/, history/, and scope/ collapse to.
  #
  # What it no longer holds is Proof — the evidence ledger and the risk gates,
  # which moved to lib/core/proof.rb on 2026-08-12. Memory answers what was
  # said; Proof answers whether it was enough. Reach the second through
  # `memory.proof`, deliberately rather than through forwarding methods: a
  # delegator would have kept the public count where it was and hidden the seam
  # that the count existed to point at.

    # constrained host the budget shrinks and compaction runs sooner. This is the
    # whole of the old HostBudget the core needs — the guard rides on Memory's
    # existing compaction, so the Fold gains no new logic. The rest of HostBudget
    # (TTS toggles, pid reaping, shell tips) is CLI accretion that dies with lib.
