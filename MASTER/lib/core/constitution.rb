  # through the rules here before the World performs anything. This is where the
  # old council, scan, judge, biases, veto, evidence, sharp_edges, and the Guard
  # all live now: not as subsystems, but as rules over effects. One `admit`.
  #
  # A rule watches a verb, judges an effect against the live data/*.yml (the one
  # source), and returns Allow (pass), Revise (rewrite for the rules after it),
  # or Block (stop). admit folds them: the first Block wins; Revises carry
  # forward; what comes out the end is the effect the World will perform.
