  # Proof — what has been shown, and what must be shown before `done`.
  #
  # The seventh concept in the fold, and the first raise of `core_files` since
  # the spine was written. It came out of Memory, which was three objects wearing
  # one name: a transcript, an evidence ledger, and the risk gates. That is why
  # it measured 16 public methods against ABSTRACTION's 10 — not an idiom this
  # time, the way Constitution's class methods were, but the count telling the
  # truth about the design.
  #
  # The seam is where the Constitution looks. Every rule that can refuse a `done`
  # effect asks this object and nothing else: proved?, council_required?,
  # council_cleared?, ideation_satisfied?. Memory answers what was said; Proof
  # answers whether it was enough.
  class Proof
    # What counts as proof, and how much of it ends the turn. This is the one
    # Ruby source for the core's evidence policy; the Model's prompt is built
    # from it (no restated numbers) and a test pins it to data/rules.yml, whose
    # evidence_scoring the lib spine still reads until that spine is severed.

    # What can actually produce each kind of proof. The kind was whatever the
    # model wrote in the effect, so `exec(["true"], evidence: "test_pass")` was
    # worth 35 points and four such calls ended the turn — the fold graded its own
    # paper. A command that does not run the tests cannot be a passing test run.
    #
    # Unmatched scores nothing rather than blocking: the fold may run whatever it
    # likes, it cannot claim credit for it. Refusing the effect outright
    # would turn a wrong label into a dead turn, and the label is the model's
    # mistake to correct on the next one.
