    #
    # Those are two different things and one name covered both. Segmentation and
    # rests are rhythm, which every utterance wants; the pentatonic pitch targets
    # are a stylistic mode that only lyrical text should get. Because
    # build_phrase_plan always attached both, the whole plan sat behind
    # Transcendent's melodic_threshold and ordinary speech was rendered as one
    # Edge call with one rate and one pitch, start to finish. `melodic: false`
    # keeps the phrases and the rests and drops the contour, so a phrase inherits
    # the resolved rate/pitch through Engines.synthesize_phrase_parts' fetch
    # defaults.
