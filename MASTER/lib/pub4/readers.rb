  # This exists because "its only reader is X" has been wrong four times, and
  # each time it was wrong the same way: someone counted readers with a grep
  # that could not see the reference that mattered.
  #
  #   hash_dig_compat.rb  merged into MASTER/test/test_helper.rb as "its only
  #                       reader". STUDIO's dilla/lib/music_gems.rb required it
  #                       by File.expand_path from another tree, inside a
  #                       `rescue LoadError`, so it did not even raise — dilla
  #                       rendered without coltrane for days.
  #   RepoMap             renamed on a reader count that missed a same-named
  #                       class in a different namespace.
  #   _search_loading     deleted as unused; it is the shared partial a contract
  #                       test asserts.
  #   Log::Evidence       deleted as dead; specified-but-unused is not dead, and
  #                       it had a test.
  #
  # The spellings below are the ones that defeated those greps. A basename
  # search alone finds none of the path-built requires; a `require_relative`
  # search alone finds none of the runtime `File.expand_path` ones.
