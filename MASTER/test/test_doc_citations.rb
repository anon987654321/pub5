# DEBT.md held a copy of spine.yml's raise log and drifted from it. The commit
# that fixed that (f34907d40) says so in its own message — and within a day
# DECISIONS.md was left claiming a rebaseline to 38823 against spine.yml's
# 38811, by the session that had just read the fix. Twice in two days, same
# defect, same file pair.

    # claim about a past sequence, wearing a marker that holds it to the value
    # data/ currently has. Every later raise turned a true statement about history
    # into a failing claim about the present, and it drifted within two days.

    # wrong to exist, because the sentence was never asserting a current value.
