# frozen_string_literal: true

# Every scan rule that carries worked examples must satisfy them.
#
# Across seven categories audited in RAILS/FINAL_TODO.md, six failed the same
# way: the rule matched a pattern adjacent to the law it enforced.
#
#   TIME_ZONE_UNSAFE     matched Time.now; the law is about Time.zone, and
#                        Time.now.utc / Time.now.to_i read neither.
#   rb_long_method       counted the start..end span; the law is about how much
#                        logic a method holds, so it penalised comments.
#   css_px_width         read an @media condition as an element width.
#   target_no_controller knew one of the three ways a controller registers.
#
# Every one of those is a false *positive*: the rule fires where the law is
# satisfied. A rule that carries the case it must not fire on cannot drift that
# way in silence, which is why does_not_fire matters more here than fires.
#
# Add examples to a rule with RuleDSL.rule(..., fires:, does_not_fire:).
