# The council's front door, and every existing test called it one way.
#
# test_council_personas and test_dilla_council both do
# `Selector.for(task: :ui)` and `Selector.for(task: :sonic)`. Neither ever
# passed a risk, and neither ever passed `available:` -- so the class had two
# defects that only the untried arguments could show:
#
#   task AND risk        raised NoMethodError. `base_personas` ended in a
#                        trailing `if task_set.nil? || risk_set.nil?`, which
#                        guards the whole expression, so having both returned
#                        nil and `select` called nil + ALWAYS_INCLUDED.
#   available:           was inert. `normalize_available` was `nil unless
#                        available`, which returns nil whether or not a list was
#                        given, so the filter in #select never ran and a caller
#                        got back personas it had told the selector it did not
#                        have.
