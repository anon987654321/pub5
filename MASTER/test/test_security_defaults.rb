# data/security.yml described a local-first, zero-listener, explicitly
# paired, fail-closed system. Exactly one of its keys had a reader. The rest — the
# gateway bind, the dashboard, the session trust tiers, the pairing TTL, the
# ingress rate limit, the five tool deny patterns — read as enforced policy and
# enforced nothing, and the ingress limit was additionally hardcoded in the
# controller so the file and the code could drift apart silently.
#
# The file now separates enforced keys from recorded intent. This test is what
# keeps that split true, in both directions: an enforced key that loses its reader
# fails, and a planned key that grows one fails until it moves up. The readers are
# named explicitly rather than grepped for the leaf name, because leaf names here
# are words like "enabled", "port" and "trust" — a name grep would find those
# anywhere and call the file enforced.
