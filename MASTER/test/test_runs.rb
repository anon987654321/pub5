# VPS safety gate, 80 assertions -- reachable from no entrypoint in the repo.
# They passed. They had always passed, because they had never run. bin/check's
# own comments record the same thing happening to test:subsystems, and
# OPENBSD/data/debt.yml records it for four RAILS gates under
# `rails_gates_not_wired`.
#
# This asserts every test file is reachable from some entrypoint.
