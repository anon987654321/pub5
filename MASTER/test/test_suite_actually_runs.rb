# A suite that reports 106 tests and runs 10 is an instrument reporting on itself.
#
# A file can be loaded by the suite and contribute none of its own runs: its
# tests never execute, its failures reach no gate, and the aggregate count hides
# it, because the aggregate is the number being misreported. Asking each file
# what it reports alone is the only view from outside.

# Slow by construction: it runs each file in its own process. Opt in with
# SUITE_AUDIT=1, or a full `rake test` would fork the whole suite per file.
