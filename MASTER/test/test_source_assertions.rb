# A test that reads a source file and greps it is a category error.
#
# It asserts that a method is *spelled* a certain way, not that it *does*
# anything: gut every body in lib/boot/runtime.rb and spec/ops/boot_safety_spec.rb
# stays green, while renaming a constant fails it with the behaviour intact. The
# file that claims to cover "MASTER never starts a background loop unless asked"
# is twenty of these in a row.
#
# It is not always wrong. Asserting that a generated file contains its banner,
# or that a manifest lists what it must list, is a genuine text property. So
# this is a ratchet rather than a ban: the number may fall and may not rise, and
# each fall is a test that started calling the thing it describes.
#
# Measured 2026-08-23: 231 across 42 files, then 228 when
# spec/ops/source_loop_guards_spec.rb stopped grepping for its guards and
# started calling them. The worst concentrations are
# test_web_ui.rb (41), spec/tools/lifecycle_tools_spec.rb (17) and
# spec/ops/boot_safety_spec.rb (16, the whole file).
