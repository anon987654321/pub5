# frozen_string_literal: true

# law/practice.rb — rules about how to work, not about what source text says.
#
# These lived in data/soul.yml because Law::Builder demanded a detector and no
# detector can exist for "sweep to convergence rather than pausing" or "one SSH
# session". The requirement was excluding exactly the rules it could not
# describe, and the operator asked three times for one place; `conduct` is that
# place. The prompt emits every rule from here, so they reach the model as they
# did from soul, and /why now answers for all of them.
#
# Fixtures are illustrative rather than executable: the shortest example of
# following the rule and of not. prove! does not scan them, and Builder still
# refuses a rule without them, because a rule with no example of its own
# subject is the unfalsifiable shape this framework exists to reject.
