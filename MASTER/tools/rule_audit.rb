# frozen_string_literal: true

# Audits the rules, not the code they judge.
#
# Every other instrument here asks whether the tree obeys the rules. This asks
# whether a rule can see its own subject, because on 2026-08-25 three could not
# and nothing said so for as long as they had existed:
#
#   FROZEN_STRING_LITERAL asks whether a file opens with the magic comment.
#   considered_text blanks comment lines before a detector reads them, so it
#   fired on 423 of 423 files under MASTER/lib that carry the comment.
#   SQUINT_TEST looks for four consecutive newlines, and a blanked comment line
#   IS a newline, so every heavily-commented file was a finding about blank
#   lines it does not have.
#
# Both passed prove! at every boot. That is the whole finding, and it is why the
# first check below exists rather than a cleverer one: a fixture proves with
# file "-", which has no extension and therefore no comment syntax, so the
# fixture is read whole while the real file is not. The proof and the production
# path disagreed about what the detector would be shown, and a rule cannot
# notice that about itself.
#
# Three deterministic checks, no model required:
#
#   fixture_blindness  Re-prove bad/good through a filename carrying a real
#                      extension for the rule's language. A rule whose verdict
#                      changes was proved against input its subjects never get.
#   saturation         Firing rate over a real corpus. A rule that flags most of
#                      what it reads is not enforcing a rule, it is describing
#                      the codebase, and its findings are noise at scale.
#   silent             Fires on nothing in the corpus. Either the tree obeys it
#                      or it is aimed at something that is not there — the
#                      distinction needs a person, so this reports and does not
#                      fail.
#
#   ruby MASTER/tools/rule_audit.rb
#   ruby MASTER/tools/rule_audit.rb --json
#
# The adversarial half — steelman the rule, then ask what it fires on that it
# should not — belongs on top of this, not instead of it. These three are free,
# repeatable, and caught every one of the three real bugs.
