# frozen_string_literal: true

# No first-party Ruby tree is silently outside MASTER's own law.
#
# A gate whose scope is a path literal loses coverage without failing. `core/`
# lived outside the scanned `lib/` for three weeks and the gates stayed green;
# the engines migration made four scanners stop seeing 57 views and the falling
# lint baseline read as improvement. Shrinking looks like winning.
#
# So this reports what was COVERED, not only what failed, and refuses a
# directory that is in neither list. See data/scan_coverage.yml.
