# Which entrypoint runs a given file, and which files nothing runs.
#
# "Does anything read this?" is the question that takes an afternoon in this
# repo and should take a second. amber's architecture record was deleted and
# nothing noticed because nothing read it; four RAILS scanners stopped seeing 57
# views when the verticals moved to engines, and the falling finding count read
# as improvement. Both are the same question, unasked.

#   ruby MASTER/tools/runs.rb --json
#
# Reachability is computed, not declared: the globs come out of the runner files
# themselves, so a glob that changes in the Rakefile changes the answer here
# without anyone updating a list. The only declared part is CONVENTIONS, for
# runners whose glob lives inside a framework rather than in this repo.
