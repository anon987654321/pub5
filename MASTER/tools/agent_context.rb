#
# MASTER keeps 17 memory classes, 830 files under knowledge/ and 1,251 under
# .master/. Claude Code keeps its own memory directory. Nothing in lib/, tools/
# or bin/ reads ~/.claude, and nothing writes MASTER's learnings back to it —
# two memories in one repo with no path between them.

#   ruby MASTER/tools/agent_context.rb                 # the standing context
#   ruby MASTER/tools/agent_context.rb "<prompt>"      # plus what matches it
#
# Designed for a UserPromptSubmit hook, so it has to be small: data/rules.yml is
# 3,108 lines and injecting it every turn would drown the turn. What goes out is
# the binding half — the code rules that constrain output, what the gate can
# actually block on, and how much of the law is unmeasured right now.
