# frozen_string_literal: true

# How many rules can fire, and under what conditions.
#
# A rule in data/rules.yml reaches code three ways: a lexical detector, a
# structural one, or a semantic prompt folded into SemanticRule's single call
# per file. A rule with none of those is law that no configuration can enforce,
# and it counts toward "225 rules" in every report that quotes the total.
#
#   ruby MASTER/tools/rule_reach.rb
#   ruby MASTER/tools/rule_reach.rb --ratchet
#
# The semantic prompt drops info-severity violations deliberately — they double
# the token cost of every file for findings nobody acts on. That exclusion is a
# decision, so this counts its result rather than arguing with it, and refuses
# to let the unreachable set grow.
