# Files that are one concept wearing several names.
#
# Every structural rule in data/rules.yml points one way: SMALL_FILES,
# NO_GOD_CLASS and INTEGRATED_SYSTEMS all say "split further". None says "these
# three are one thing", so no scan proposes a merge, and one concept spread over
# three files that reference each other in both directions stays that way.

#
# It emits a plan rather than a patch. Moving code between files is not a
# line-level edit and MASTER's autofix transforms are all line-level; a merge
# also has to respect load order, which is a property of the tree and not of any
# file. So this states what to do, in what order, and what to check — and a
# person or a model does the surgery.
#
# Two plan kinds, because two tree shapes need opposite surgery.
#
# MERGE, for files with no namespace of their own: dilla's engine defines its
# methods on Object, so render_seed.rb and render_techno.rb genuinely can become
# one render.rb. Gated on bidirectional reference, which is what separates a
# family from a prefix that merely reads alike.
#
# REGROUP, for files that each declare their own constant: under Zeitwerk a file
# path *is* a constant name, so Ground::SandboxPolicy and Ground::SubagentPolicy
# cannot be merged into one policy.rb — the loader would refuse it. What they
# want is a shelf: lib/ground/policy/sandbox.rb defining Ground::Policy::Sandbox.
# The signal is different too. A merge needs proof the files are one concept; a
# regroup only needs a drawer with five things of one kind in it, because the
# gain is navigational rather than structural.
#
# Both prefix and suffix families, because trees name families both ways and
# grouping on `split("_").first` alone saw only one of them. dilla writes
# render_seed / render_techno; MASTER writes sandbox_policy / workflow_policy.
# Reading only prefixes made this tool structurally blind to MASTER's own shape:
# it reported "nothing to merge" for lib/ground, lib/review, lib/cli and
# lib/voice — 325 files — and the reason was the matcher, not the tree.
