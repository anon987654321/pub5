# The truth was spread across ten instruments — rake selftest, rake selfcheck,
# lint:spine, four Pub4::*Lint modules, gates/data/css_budget.yml,
# coverage_ratchet_test.rb and file_length_ratchet_test.rb — each with its own
# invocation and its own idea of where the number lives. On 2026-08-11 four of
# them were stale and were found by accident, one at a time, while doing unrelated
# work. A register nobody can read in one pass is a register nobody reads.
#
# Two failures, not one. A ratchet is broken when the current value is ABOVE its
# ceiling (new debt) and equally when it is BELOW and the ceiling was never
# lowered (slack the next change grows into without failing anything). Only
# chrome_i18n_lint tested for the second; this makes it the contract for all of
# them.
