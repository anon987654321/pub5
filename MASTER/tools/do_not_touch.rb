# A "Do Not Touch" entry must name the gate that fails when its claim stops
# being true — or say plainly that no gate can hold it, and why.
#
# START_HERE.md's item 2 said the rule shards stayed split because they sat near
# their consumers. That was false, and had been false for as long as the shards
# existed: the four of them had one consumer between them, `load_rules`, which
# concatenated them back into a single hash before any scanner saw them. Nobody
# was careless. The entry stated a conclusion, and conclusions do not rot loudly
# — it took an operator override in 2026-08 to find out the reason had never
# been true.
#
# Had the entry named the test its reason implied — each shard has a distinct
# reader — that test would have been red from the first day and the entry would
# have re-argued itself years before anyone had to override it by hand.
#
# So every entry carries one of:
#
#   — gate: `rake lint:spine`, `test/core/test_no_lib_backedges.rb`
#   — no gate: <why the claim cannot be mechanically held>
#
# and this checks that the named rake tasks and files actually exist. A gate
# reference that stops resolving is the same failure one level up.
