# frozen_string_literal: true

# Integrity of the rule catalogue itself: ids, aliases, and the metadata every
# report quotes.
#
# Three checks, each one that survived being measured. Two more were proposed and
# died on contact with the data, which is worth recording so nobody re-proposes
# them:
#
#   "every alias must resolve to a live id" is backwards. An alias IS a retired
#   id — KISS carries long_method, god_class, nesting_depth and arity because it
#   absorbed them. An alias pointing at a live rule is the defect, not the
#   reverse.
#
#   "a folder must not share a name with a file inside it" flags a normal Ruby
#   idiom. rexml/rexml.rb, drb/drb.rb and mail/mail.rb all do it, and so do
#   law/law.rb and lib/cli/cli.rb.
