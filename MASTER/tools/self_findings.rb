# What MASTER's own rules find in MASTER's own tree.
#
# The question "would running MASTER through its own rules make it tidier" has a
# number, and this is it. Every rule with a lexical detector, over every tracked
# Ruby file in the four trees.
#
# Lexical only, on purpose. The full gate runs /scan with the semantic pass and
# blocks on a model call — measured 2026-08-25 at 17 minutes elapsed against 4
# minutes of CPU, idle in a TLS read, on its way to a 20-minute stage timeout.
# A number that needs a network and an API key is a number nobody has. These 70
# rules need neither and finish in about a minute.
