# Decisions

Agent and runtime policy. Deploy and VPS policy lives in `OPENBSD/DECISIONS.md`.

This file records intentional shapes that may otherwise look like bugs.

## Portfolio Freeze Aligns With OPENBSD (2026-07)

See `OPENBSD/DECISIONS.md` — **No Fourth Public App Until brgen Boundaries Hold**. MASTER work should prefer subtraction (one generated agent context, structural vs cosmetic scan severity) over new portfolio apps. Do not invent a seventh product surface from agent sessions without that ADR being revisited.

## Enforcement Is On The Write, Not On The Command (2026-08-15)

`/scan` and `/fix` are diagnostics now, not the enforcement path. Every write
goes through `Review::Scan::WriteGuard` on both lanes — `Io::Base#commit_write`
for the tools, an injected `:write` rule in `Core::Constitution` for the Fold —
and a write that introduces an error-, critical- or veto-severity finding is
refused with the findings as the reason.

Three shapes here look wrong from outside and are not:

- **It judges the delta, not the file.** A file already carrying a violation
  stays writable; only a new one blocks. Blocking on file state would refuse the
  first repair of every file that needs repairing, which is the opposite of the
  ratchet intended.
- **Semantic rules are excluded.** 126 of the 225 need an LLM, at one call per
  file, and a before-and-after gate pays that twice per write. They belong to a
  per-turn pass over the files a turn touched. Until that exists, the semantic
  half of the law still waits for `/scan`.
- **The Constitution takes the scanner as a parameter.** `Constitution.load`
  accepts `verify:` and `lib/cli/core_bridge.rb` supplies it. A `require` would
  have been shorter and would have put `lib/review/` inside the fold spine,
  which `test/core/test_no_lib_backedges.rb` exists to prevent.

Six stages were deleted to pay for it, and every one was constructed nowhere or
only by another of the six. `Stages::Guard` scanned messages for prompt
injection — `Builder::AiBoot` still runs `InjectionGuard`. This sentence named
`Ground::Tool::Contract` as a second runner until 2026-08-25, and it never was
one: nothing called that module, its gate fired only on tool names no live tool
has, and its `:strict` mode is default-deny, which would have refused `ls -la`.
It is deleted; the guard that runs is `:permissive`, in AiBoot, alone. `Stages::Deliberate` wrapped a coding message with "list four
approaches first" — `Proof#ideation_satisfied?` enforces that at the gate now.
`Stages::Review` orchestrated the other three and was built by nothing.
`Stages::Lint` scanned written paths after the fact, which is `WriteGuard`'s job
and now happens before the write. `Stages::Prune` duplicated `Voice::StrunkPass`
constant for constant, both loading `voice.strunk` from `data/voice.yml`; the one
thing it had that StrunkPass does not is a prose-level evidence nag, and
`evidence_for_done_rule` blocks the effect rather than annotating the sentence.
`Stages::Council` existed so `/review on|off` could toggle a flag on it; the
deliberation subsystem it wrapped is live and reached three other ways —
`Stages::DestructiveReview`, `CouncilCrit` behind the Fold's `critique` verb, and
`/critique`. `/review <path>` still runs the reviewer personas, which is the only
thing that command ever did that ran.

`lib/` fell 392 code lines, from 39222 to 38830.

## One Spine, With The Dependency Rule Kept (2026-08-12)

**This reverses "Two Master Spines", which stood from 2026-07-30 to 2026-08-12 and is superseded by operator instruction.** The prior text is below the line, because a decision that was reversed is more useful than a decision that was quietly deleted.

`core/` is now `lib/core.rb` + `lib/core/`, autoloaded by the same Zeitwerk loader as the rest of `lib/`. The path-to-constant mapping already wanted exactly this: `push_dir(lib, namespace: Master)` makes `lib/core.rb` → `Master::Core` and `lib/core/fold.rb` → `Master::Core::Fold`. The merge needed no new entries in `data/autoload.yml` — `rake lint:autoload` still reports 44 ignores, all necessary.

Two things the old split was carrying, and where each went:

- **The dependency direction survives, as a test.** The fold must not reach into the application spine. That was enforced by a directory boundary and is now enforced by `test/core/test_no_lib_backedges.rb`, which names the fold's files explicitly and fails if any of them requires a sibling under `lib/`. It also asserts it found the files at all, since a glob that matches nothing passes silently.
- **`core_files` survives, counted differently.** `lib/{core.rb,core/*.rb}` — the directory plus the entrypoint beside it. Globbing only `lib/core/` would have read one under the ceiling and handed out a free concept. It stood at 6 through the merge and was raised to 7 <!-- cite: data/spine.yml#spine.core_files --> on 2026-08-12 for `Proof`.

What the merge removed, beyond a directory: `MASTER/bin/master-core` put `core/` on `$LOAD_PATH` and called `require "master"`, so which of the two `master.rb` files won was decided by load-path order. `bin/nsaudit` had to hand-require the second spine so the first one's constants would resolve. Both are gone.

`lib_code_ceiling` was rebaselined 38285 → 38811 and **not** recorded as a raise: 554 code lines moved in, `lib/` reports +526, so excluding the moved files `lib/` fell 28. The arithmetic is in `data/spine.yml` so the claim is checkable rather than asserted. It was raised three times after that: once for `Review::Scan::CodeMetrics` — one line counter where there had been three — once to close the fold-spine findings the merge exposed, and once for `d35b40ec0`'s `worn_type` accessors, which took an operator decision to clear the raise log because nothing was left to absorb.

The figure that used to sit in that sentence is deliberately gone. It carried a `cite:` marker, so `rake lint:doc_citations` held it to the value `data/` currently holds — and the sentence is about a past sequence, so every subsequent raise made a true statement about history read as a false claim about now. It drifted within two days and failed the gate. `data/spine.yml` has the number and the whole log; this paragraph has the story.

---

*Superseded 2026-08-12 — retained for the reasoning, not as current policy:*

> `lib/` and `core/` are intentionally separate load paths. `lib/` is the gem, CLI, loop, judge, reach, trace, voice, and web-facing runtime. `core/` is a small isolated constitutional fold loaded on its own path by the core tests and `MASTER/bin/master-core`.
>
> Core types live under `Master::Core::` (not top-level `Master::`) so they coexist with lib constants in one process — the runtime cutover loads `core/` into the CLI via the bridge. `bin/nsaudit` loads the core entrypoint explicitly; the two-spine design is deliberate, not accidental duplication. (The module was named `Master::Kernel` until it was renamed to `Master::Core` to stop shadowing Ruby's built-in `::Kernel`.)
>
> Namespace tooling should treat `MASTER/bin/master-core` as the core load entrypoint.

## The Spine Ratchet Replaces An Unmeasured Invariant

`core/ABSORPTION.md` (now `docs/SEVERANCE.md`) asserted "the spine never grows" and nothing checked it.
In the three weeks after `core/` landed, `lib/` gained 8,022 lines and `core/`
gained none. That file is now `docs/SEVERANCE.md`, a record of what was cut
rather than a plan, and this document is the standing policy on the spine.

What is enforced instead: `rake lint:spine` reads `data/spine.yml` and fails
when `lib/` grows past its recorded ceiling or the fold spine gains a file.
The ceiling only ratchets down (`RATCHET=1` records a new low); raising it is a
deliberate edit with a reason in the commit. Part of `rake audit`.

### The invariant, settled 2026-08-11

The ceiling has now been raised three times (2026-07-31, 2026-08-01, 2026-08-11)
and its unit changed once. `data/spine.yml`'s own note said that if it were raised
again without `lib/` ever falling back, "the honest conclusion is that 'the spine
never grows' is not the invariant anyone is holding". `lib/` did fall back twice,
by deletion — and on the third raise there was nothing dead left to pay with: a
sweep of all 445 files returned one candidate and it was a false positive.

So the sentence is retired and replaced by the two things that are actually true:

- **`core_files` is the invariant.** A new top-level concept in the fold is a
  design change and must be argued for. It is what "the spine" means.

  *Amended 2026-08-12.* This bullet used to end "This has never been raised and
  should not be." It has now been raised once, 6 → 7, for `Master::Core::Proof`
  — and the raise is the mechanism working rather than failing. `Memory` measured
  16 public methods against ABSTRACTION's 10 and could not be brought under it by
  declaring visibility the way `Constitution` could, because every method had a
  caller. The count was telling the truth: Memory was a transcript, an evidence
  ledger, and the risk gates wearing one name, and the Constitution reached past
  the first to ask the other two. The invariant did not stop the seventh concept;
  it made the seventh concept get argued for, which is all it was ever able to
  do. What it must keep refusing is a file added because something felt long.
- **`lib_code_ceiling` is a budget with a sponsor, not a promise.** It exists so
  growth is visible and has to be asked for. A raise needs a named sponsor and the
  per-commit accounting in `spine.yml`; `consecutive_raises_allowed: 2` refuses the
  third until `lib/` genuinely falls.

  *Amended 2026-08-13.* That refusal fired for the first time, and what it caught
  was somebody else's 9 unaccounted lines with nothing left to absorb — three
  sweeps for dead code came back empty. The operator cleared the raise log by
  decision rather than by a fall, which is a turn of the mechanism taken by hand
  and is recorded as a single dated event in `spine.yml`. `consecutive_raises_allowed`
  stays 2 and nothing about the mechanism is weaker. The refusal worked exactly as
  intended: it converted a silent bump into an argument.

Nothing about the mechanism changes — this only stops the file claiming an
invariant that three raises have already disproved. A number nobody believes is
worse than a budget everybody reads.

## Worn Type Is What The Visitor Sees (2026-08-12)

`design_rules.yml` already stated Bringhurst's 66ch, a modular scale, a golden split, and Vignelli's one-accent budget. `design_metrics` grepped stylesheets for those numbers. A 600px feed — `feed_max`, in `shared_chrome` and `social` — is at brgen's 18px root a short measure (~45ch), not 66ch, and the two sources disagreed in silence.

The law is now `worn_type:` in the same file. `RAILS/gates/support/geometry_type.rb` is the reader: it takes the probe's worn characters, computed sizes, baselines, tabular figures, accent hues, empty ratio, and main/aside split, and judges each surface under a named profile (`feed`, `catalog`, `chat`, `immersive`, `map`, `legal`, `auth`). `--feed-max: 600px` stays the feed column. `measure_body: 66ch` stays the legal/prose column. They are different jobs.

`Master::Design::Thresholds.worn_profile` is the Ruby face. `MASTER/test/test_design_rules_worn_type.rb` fails if a profile has no reader.

## Rule Data Folded Into One File (2026-08-12)

**This reverses "Rule Data Stays Split", by the same operator instruction as the spine merge.**

`data/rules.yml` is the whole scanner law: all 225 rules under one `rules:` key, in the four scopes the scanners already asked for by name (`codebase` 52, `file` 21, `line` 80, `unit` 72). The four `data/rules/*.yml` shards are gone, and so is `merge_rule_shards` in `lib/boot/data.rb` — the loader now reads one file.

The fold was textual rather than a Psych round-trip, so every comment in the shards survived; a YAML load-and-dump would have stripped the lot, and those comments are where the rules explain themselves. `Master.load_rules` was proved deep-equal to its pre-fold output before the shards were deleted.

The old entry's argument was proximity to consumers. It did not hold up: the shards had **one** consumer between them — `load_rules`, which concatenated all four back into a single hash before any scanner saw them. The split was proximity for readers, not for code, and it cost a directory plus a merge step that could disagree with itself.

`data/llm_output_rules.yml` and `data/rule_deps.yml` **do** each have separate consumers (`Master::Design`, `Master::Review::OutputCheck`, `Master::Fix::FixLoop`) and stay where they are. That part of the old entry was right and is not affected.

`data/design_rules.yml` had one too, and folded anyway: proximity to a consumer is worth less than a single definition. Split from `style.yml`, it defined `typography` twice with different numbers, under a `SelfTest` exemption that named the duplication and allowed it.

## Phrase Rhythm Ships On, Phrase Language Ships Off (2026-08-17)

`Melody` plans phrase segmentation, inter-phrase rests, a pentatonic pitch
contour, and — since this date — a per-phrase voice. Three switches, not one, and
the asymmetry between them is deliberate:

- **`phrase_rhythm_enabled: true`.** Segmentation and rests are rhythm, which
  every utterance wants. They used to sit behind `melodic_threshold` with the
  contour, so ordinary speech was one Edge call at one rate and one pitch.
- **`melodic_threshold`** still gates the pentatonic contour alone. That is a
  stylistic mode and belongs to lyrical text only.
- **`phrase_language_switching: false`.** `data/voice.yml` sets
  `single_voice: osman` and `persona_affects_text_only: true`. Reading a
  Norwegian clause with `nb-NO-FinnNeural` means two voices in one utterance,
  which is the one thing that contradicts that policy. The mechanism is built so
  the choice is a flag rather than a rewrite; flipping it is an operator
  decision about identity, not a bug fix.

Do not "fix" the asymmetry by aligning the three defaults.

## Transcendent Is Not Wired To The Streaming Path (2026-08-17)

The Transcendent engine chain is unreached — see `DEBT.md`, "Inert law and
config". The obvious repair is to call it from `synthesize_streaming_to_file`,
and that is wrong as stated: `Transcendent.synthesize` returns a finished file,
while the streaming path exists to hand `TtsJob` progressive chunks through
`on_chunk` so audio starts before synthesis ends. Wiring one to the other means
buffering the whole utterance first, which trades the thing the streaming path
was built for.

So the choice is a real one — progressive playback, or emotion/melody/multi-engine
— and not a missing line. Whoever makes it should measure phrase fan-out first
(one Edge round trip per phrase, on one vCPU); that measurement is still owed.

## Pronunciation Is Respelling, Not Phonemes (2026-08-17)

`data/lexicon.yml` maps written forms to spoken ones — `relayd` to `relay D` —
rather than to IPA or SSML `<phoneme>`. That is not a shortcut. `rb_edge_tts`
takes plain text and exposes no SSML, so there is no phoneme element and no
engine-side lexicon to address; substituting a word the voice already says
correctly is the only pronunciation control that exists on this path.

The table is therefore narrow on purpose, and `test_lexicon.rb` refuses any entry
that respells a word as itself. Before extending it, check whether the word is
actually wrong when read aloud — "Falcon" and "Rails" are ordinary English words
and do not belong there.

## Names State The Assertion, Directories State The Precondition (2026-08-17)

Two rules, meant for the whole tree and not only for `RAILS/gates/`.

**A name says what the thing asserts, not what it is near.** `geometry` and
`layout_geometry` were one gate that measures boxes in a browser and one that
greps SCSS for a string, and the pair invited the reading that touch targets
were covered. They were not: the grep matched the literal `44px` while the tree
writes `var(--tap-min)`, so it passed on every app while checking no app. They
are `rendered_geometry` and `first_screen` now.

**Each gate owns one assertion.** Two gates asserting the same property is two
places to change it and two places for it to rot. `gates/lib/` was sliced by
mode — first screen, phone width, width sweep, keyboard, baseline — and every
mode then re-asserted whatever it happened to see: touch targets in three
gates, landmarks in four, overflow in four. Slice by assertion and the mode
becomes a parameter.

**MASTER names the law; RAILS names the measurement.** The Rails gate called
`reflow` measured horizontal overflow and restated 320px as "the WCAG 1.4.10
floor" — while `MASTER/lib/ground/axioms/wcag.rb` already declares that
criterion and `REFLOW_WIDTH_PX = 320`. `soul.yml` uses "reflow" for a third
thing, a refactoring verb beside "rename". A gate named after a criterion
invites the criterion to be re-declared inside it, which is this tree's dominant
defect wearing a new hat. Name the gate for what it measures and have it read
the number from MASTER.

**A directory says what the thing needs before it can run.** `gates/lib/` is
`source/ live/ rendered/ host/ research/ meta/`: files only, a booted app, a
browser, the machine, scores rather than verdicts, and gates about gates. The
precondition was previously a comment, and a gate with a missing precondition
reported a clean pass — see the exit-3 work in the same day's commits.

**A directory tree and a declared hierarchy must not be two sources.**
`gates.yml`'s `covered_by` and the directory both classify a gate. If they can
disagree they eventually will, so `covered_by` is derived from the path, never
maintained beside it.

## Local Knowledge Stays Local

`knowledge/` is gitignored and skipped by scanners/snapshots, but it still powers `Master::Io::SearchKnowledge`. Do not move it unless the search tool learns the new location first.

## Deferred WebGL Boot Is Sacred

The face runtime must not create a WebGL context before the primer tap. The guard in `web/app/views/chat/index.html.erb` protects the tap-to-start path from eager or stale assets.

## Self-Test Is A Loud Gate

`rake selftest` runs `rules.yml.self_test` against MASTER itself. It is allowed to fail while known debt remains; the point is to make debt visible and triageable.

## The Cross-File Prescan Is Advisory, And Mostly Measures Itself

`/fix` prints `prescan: N cross-file risk(s)` before it runs. On 2026-07-31 that
number was 233. All of them were adjudicated against the code; the count is not
a backlog, and it does not block anything.

**It gates nothing.** `run_fix_and_prescan` calls `anti_sprawl_prescan`, then
calls `fix_loop.run(target)` unconditionally and joins the two strings. The
prescan is text printed above the result. A reader — including an agent — can
easily take "risk(s) — merge/rename before local patch" as a precondition. It is
not one.

Adjudication of all 231 findings the prescan reproduced (2 of the original 233
had been fixed in between):

| rule | n | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| MAGIC_NUMBER_SPREAD | 88 | artefact |
| COPY_PASTE_BLOCK | 57 | artefact |
| PARALLEL_HIERARCHY | 49 | artefact |
| SCATTERED_CONFIG | 19 | checked clean |
| CROSS_FILE_DRY | 11 | 1 real, since fixed |
| SPRAWL | 7 | artefact |

The evidence, so this does not need redoing:

- **MAGIC_NUMBER_SPREAD.** `MAGIC_NUMBER` is `/(?:[2-9]|[1-9]\d{2,})/` — every
  digit 2 through 9 anywhere, plus any number over 99. Hence "literal 8 recurs
  in 141 files" and "literal 2026 recurs in 50 files", which is the year. Of the
  occurrences behind the plausible-looking findings, **32% are already a named
  constant or a named keyword argument**: `512` is flagged across
  `PATTERN_CACHE_MAX = 512`, `BINARY_SAMPLE_BYTES = 512`, `rag_chunk_tokens: 512`
  and the phrase "512-token" in a comment — four meanings, three of them already
  named. The rule fires on the definitions of the constants it recommends
  extracting.

- **COPY_PASTE_BLOCK.** 44 of 57 involve at least one non-Ruby file, and
  **zero** are duplicated first-party Ruby. The top findings are JSON manifests
  in `reports/screenshots/calibration/`, three timestamped runs of the same
  tool, which share keys because they are the same schema. "Extract a module or
  template" is being said about generated test output.

- **PARALLEL_HIERARCHY.** Includes "Master spans 441 class/module hierarchies".
  `Master` is the root namespace of the entire codebase.

- **SPRAWL.** A case-insensitive word grep: `code.match?(/\bpolicy\b/i)` over
  `%w[cost auth policy cache notify search activity provider]`, firing at four
  files. `lib/result.rb` is flagged because error classification talks about
  policy. It cannot distinguish a scattered concern from a common English word.

- **SCATTERED_CONFIG** was the one worth checking properly, and it came back
  clean. All five `MASTER_AUTOFIX` reads use the identical `== "1"` idiom;
  `MASTER_WATCH` likewise; `MASTER_EXEC_TIMEOUT` is read exactly once, into
  `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`. No drifting defaults, no contradiction.

- **CROSS_FILE_DRY** held the only real finding: `File.read(..., encoding:)`
  spelled `"UTF-8"` 32 times and `"utf-8"` 10 times. Normalised in 7fb8cc3d9.
  The rest are stdlib calls sharing a variable name, and three helpers named
  `read_text`/`read_file` that are three different error policies — nil-and-log,
  raise-but-tolerate-bad-bytes, and Result-with-validation — not three copies.

What actually stopped `/fix` was the clock, not the prescan: `fix_loop.rb:121`
returns `Result.ok("wall-clock timeout (1800s) after N pass(es)")`. Raising
`RUN_BUDGET_SECONDS` is therefore the real lever if `/fix` needs to finish, and
an earlier reading of mine that the risks were blocking it was wrong.

Before treating a prescan number as work: reproduce it with
`CrossFileAnalysis.new(root:).call(paths)` and read the findings. The printed
eight are `findings.first(8)`, never a representative sample.

## The Pixel Field Was Law Nobody Read

`design_rules.pixel_field` — 150 lines, ten subkeys — is deleted, not
deprecated. It mandated ordered dithering, limited palettes, 320x180
internal resolutions, and a thirteen-entry table mapping semantic states to
visual cell forms (checker-dither means uncertainty, pixel-spray means
entropy).

Two facts decided it. Nothing read it: `pixel_field`,
`semantic_cell_fields`, `cell_grammar`, `systemic_emotion_mapping`,
`bitmap_not_retro`, `runtime_modes` and `explainability` return zero hits
across MASTER, RAILS and STUDIO outside the YAML itself, so no scanner, gate
or prompt has ever applied it to brgen, amber or bsdports. And it
contradicts the direction the operator chose on 2026-07-18, when the
IRIX/8-bit/pixel-field aesthetic was dropped for flat brutalism — the
section was still instructing anything that read it to build the aesthetic
that had been abandoned.

Its only live agreement with current direction, no blur or bloom or glow, is
already stated four other ways: `pixel_perfection.forbidden_css`,
`ui_polish.flat_ui`, `soul.yml FLAT_UI`, and the executable
`NO_DECORATIVE_FX`. Deleting it removes no enforcement.

The wider finding it came from stands as debt: five of thirteen
`design_rules` subkeys were wholly inert, and the same value is legal at two
different paths in three places (touch minimum at `ux_laws.fitts` and
`layout_rules.touch`; the spacing scale at `pixel_perfection.eight_px_rhythm`
and `layout_rules.grid`), which is why `Design::Thresholds` reads them as
fallback chains. Deduplicating those requires editing every reader and is
not this commit.
