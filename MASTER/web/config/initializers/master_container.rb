  # there costs a container nobody uses and leaves a tts-worker daemon behind
  # for every precompile, which is why rc_pre kept accumulating orphaned
  # workers.
  #
  # It is not why master would not start. That was the master_web_assets gate
  # refusing on face.css :root drift, which rc_pre logs to syslog while rcctl
  # prints nothing -- so the refusal read as a hang. spawn_daemon already
  # redirects the child's stdio to a log and passes close_others, so no worker
  # ever held rc.d's pipe. Recorded because the first explanation here said it
  # did, and a wrong reason in a comment outlives the bug it misdescribes.

  # Master carries its own Zeitwerk loader and never eager-loads, so its
  # constants resolve by autoload on first reference. Zeitwerk autoloading is
  # not thread-safe, and the web tier arranges the one collision that matters:
  # ApplicationController names Master::Ground::Tool::Profile in its class body,
  # which Rails evaluates on the first request — inside the window where the
  # bootstrap thread is autoloading Master constants of its own. The collision
  # surfaces as `uninitialized constant Master::Ground::Tool::Profile`, and it
  # takes out any request that lands in the window, including a warming probe.
  #
  # 160 ms for the namespace, once, against a container bootstrap measured in
  # seconds. Eager-loading all of Master would cost 941 ms and delay /up, which
  # is the thing the bootstrap thread exists to avoid.
