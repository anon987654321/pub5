  # NOTE: this file's own header comment claims its limits are "sourced from
  # data/ops/visual.yml" — they are not; it's a static asset that never reads
  # that file, and the two sets of numbers currently disagree entirely
  # (YAML: 30/400/96, JS: 24/200/64). That's a real SINGULARITY violation
  # worth fixing deliberately (e.g. render this as .js.erb, or fetch a small
  # JSON config at boot) rather than papering over here — this spec pins the
  # values actually shipping today so drift is visible, not the YAML's.
