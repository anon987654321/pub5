# CLAUDE.md

One screen. Everything else is reference, reached from here.

Authority order: `MASTER/data/soul.yml` > `MASTER/data/rules.yml` > this file >
the per-tree contract. Feature truth is `RAILS/apps.yml`.

This file points; it does not copy. Every subsystem keeps its own contract and
those files are maintained, so restating them here produces a second source that
drifts. The previous version was deleted at `6cdd2cb97` after exactly that — it
still described a `DEPLOY/` tree and `lib/now,judge,loop` modules that had been
renamed.

## The four trees

| | what it is | entry point |
|---|---|---|
| `MASTER/` | A constitutional AI runtime in pure Ruby. The primary product. | `MASTER/bin/master "<instruction>"` |
| `RAILS/` | Three Rails 8 apps: **brgen** (a city social network; its verticals are mounted engines), **amber** (wardrobe), **bsdports**. | `RAILS/bin/triangle up` |
| `OPENBSD/` | The deploy pipeline and the VPS runbook. Production is one box, `vm23`. | `MASTER/bin/pub4 vps state` |
| `STUDIO/` | Media tools. **dilla** makes beats, **postpro** grades images, **repligen**/**lora** generate. | `ruby STUDIO/dilla/dilla.rb` |

Nothing else sits at the repo root but this file.

## Commands

```zsh
MASTER/bin/pub4 status               # what is dirty, per tree
MASTER/bin/pub4 test                 # the suites
MASTER/bin/pub4 measure              # every ratchet, current vs ceiling
MASTER/bin/pub4 worktree <name>      # your own checkout — see the first trap
MASTER/bin/pub4 vps state | deploy   # the box

cd MASTER && bin/check               # ordinary code
cd MASTER && bin/check --profile=agent   # law, scanners, fix loop
cd MASTER && bin/check --profile=web     # the face
cd MASTER && bin/check --profile=full    # release gate
ruby RAILS/gates/runner.rb --all     # every RAILS gate
```

Run the smallest check that proves the work, and do not report done without its
output. `--profile=agent` may fail on known debt tagged `agent-ignore`; do not
chase scan noise on unrelated patches.

`MASTER/bin/master "<instruction>"` is the repo-wide instruction surface — the
runtime booted so `data/soul.yml` and the sibling trees all resolve. Bare
`MASTER/bin/master` opens a session, and slash commands work as in
`MASTER/bin/cli` because it is that runtime. `MASTER/bin/pub4` is the operator
surface. Two surfaces, no third.

## Five traps, in the order they will bite you

1. **The checkout is shared.** Several agents edit this tree at once. `git commit -a`
   sweeps up someone else's half-finished work, and `git push` publishes every
   commit beneath yours. Take `MASTER/bin/pub4 worktree <name>`, or at minimum
   commit path-scoped: `git commit -- <paths>` with no prior `git add`.
2. **Strict loading is on in every environment.** Reading a lazy association off a
   record fetched by id raises, in test and production both. Associations carrying
   a `:destroy` cascade are exempt (`Shared::CascadingAssociationsLoad`), which is
   easy to get backwards either way. Check before you claim a 500.
3. **A deploy sheds amber and bsdports**, and relayd keeps answering TLS with their
   ports closed — so the outage looks like a hang, not a 5xx. `vps-deploy` restores
   them; deploying by hand, check ports 61352 and 47312.
4. **The apps default to Norwegian.** Tests assert through I18n keys, never English
   literals, and a hardcoded English string is a defect rather than a placeholder.
5. **Renders are irreplaceable.** dilla and postpro write real output with rotating
   seeds. Never render over a take that matters, and never change a rendered-sound
   or graded-look default on your own judgement.

## Working in a shared index

`MASTER/bin/pub4 hooks` installs two guards. `pre-commit` refuses a commit
spanning more than one top-level tree — the `git commit -a` signature — unless
`PUB4_CROSS_TREE=1`, and prints everything it leaves behind. `pre-push` refuses
to publish more than one commit unless `PUB4_PUSH_ALL=1`, listing each with its
author and age.

Neither can tell sessions apart; nothing in git can. Path scoping bounds the
commit, not the push — `git push` sends every commit beneath yours, and on
2026-08-10 one push carried four commits another session had told its user were
still local. Run `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` before pushing and say in
your report what went with you. There is no per-commit push; the only real fix is
a worktree.

Paths do not identify sessions either. Everything commits as the same author, and
inferring "this is my tree, so this is my commit" was wrong twice on 2026-08-10,
when three sessions were in `RAILS/` at once. Read the commit body before
claiming or disclaiming one.

## Two habits this repo learned the hard way

**Verify the instrument before the finding.** Naive pattern-matching over this
tree produces mostly false positives — five candidate findings died on
verification in one week, one report had to be retracted after the test written
to prove it passed with the fix reverted, and a dead-file census was wrong forty
times out of forty because it searched for `context_provider` while every caller
wrote `Master::Ground::ContextProvider`. Before calling config inert, find the
reader. Before calling code wrong, check what your scan measured.

**A comment states the present-tense reason.** Not what the code used to do —
that is what `git log` and the decision records are for.

## House rules

**Ruby and zsh, not GNU text tools.** `sed`, `awk`, `find`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`,
`perl` and `python` are banned in agent shell calls and committed scripts: BSD
variants break GNU idioms and this repo deploys to OpenBSD. Use `ruby -e`, zsh
globs and builtins, or the dedicated file tools.

**Read the man page before touching OpenBSD config.** For any `OPENBSD/` or vm23
change, read the full man page for the file *and* its daemon first, from the VPS.

**Never commit** `MASTER/knowledge/`, `MASTER/output/`, `.master/`, secrets, or
generated assets. Keys live in `/etc/*.env` on the VPS.

**Production is vm23 only** (`dev@brgen.no`). One app CI/deploy at a time. After
`git pull` on the box, run `vps-deploy` before expecting live health.

## Where the rest lives

| Working on | Read |
|---|---|
| Anything in MASTER | `MASTER/START_HERE.md`, then `MASTER/AGENTS.md` |
| The web face, WebGL, TTS | `MASTER/web/CLAUDE.md` |
| Deploy, the VPS, rc.d, relayd | `OPENBSD/CLAUDE.md`, then `OPENBSD/RUNBOOK.md` |
| RAILS CSS or visual work | `RAILS/shared/WIRING_NOTES.md`, then `RAILS/shared/LAYOUT.md` |
| brgen's city hosts and verticals | `RAILS/brgen/AGENTS.md` |
| Why something odd is deliberate | `MASTER/DECISIONS.md`, `OPENBSD/DECISIONS.md` |
| Known debt, and what not to chase | `MASTER/DEBT.md`, `OPENBSD/data/debt.yml` |
